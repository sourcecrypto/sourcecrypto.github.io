### Depreciated

**A discord server and web-portal for creating an open-source, public-domain, index of Crypto Knowledge.**

[Source Crypto Discord Chat](https://discord.gg/ahTuPMY) is a landing pad.. I drop links there on the fly, occasionaly exporting and publishing the [channels](/archive/) here. The next step is to systematically build better, more organized resources with the server as a starting point.

The aim is to generally map out the history and knowledge related to Bitcoin and blockchain in general.

There is so much to learn about, I mostly manage to avoid thinking about scammy stuff and icos, and really whatever you are hyped about, I probably don't care. So the application section is in rough shape.. I don't spend a lot of time there. Tech, History, Development, Webwork. I care about real web technologies.

So, little by little, those un-organized pages will grow to become each a formidible resource of its own.

While I do intend to build custom pages for most of these channels, being able to simply export the entire discord server and publish it is excellent.

[**Source⧉Crypto Discord server**](https://discord.gg/ahTuPMY) - I collect and categorize links in here, on the fly.

Previously, I was putting information in TOML format. Then, after I started to learn GitHub pages, and working with some other people on a similar project for Decentralized Identity, I realized that GitHub Pages \ Jekyll have built-in support for yaml, csv, and json... but I haven't really gotten so far as figuring that out. 

Recently, I found [Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/) which quickly turned the entire contents of Source Crypto Discord Server into 170+ html files. 

Then, I used minimal-mistakes collections feature to quickly publish the lot of them, using VSCode to easily edit all of the files at the same time. 

I cut out the head of each of the files and injected the css to be applied to those pages.

That's a super quick way to get all that content up here on the web where anyone can access it more easily.

* [sourcecrypto/sourcecrypto.github.io](https://github.com/sourcecrypto/sourcecrypto.github.io) -  Now I have a few complete and proper toml files converted to json that I can use to experiment with generating pages - listing by title, tag, and incorporating search functionality, or perhaps filter by user-input.
