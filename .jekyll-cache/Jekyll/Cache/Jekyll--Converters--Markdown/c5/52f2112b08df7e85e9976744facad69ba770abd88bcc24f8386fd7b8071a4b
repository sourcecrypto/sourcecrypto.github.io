Or you may be communicating with a political dissident in a repressive country.\n Whatever it is, you donâ€™t want your private electronic mail (email) or confidential documents read by anyone else. Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with asserting your privacy. Privacy is as apple-pie as the Constitution.â€</p>
