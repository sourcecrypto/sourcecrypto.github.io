It is not designed to select coins that will have the most positive returns or identify coins with negative returns. It is designed to identify the coins that have the greatest chances of outperforming and the coins with the greatest chances of underperforming. Outperforming and underperforming is relative to the crypto universe. Therefore if the average crypto coin is up 1000% the dark green coins, in aggregate, would be attempting to beat that. If the average coin is down 50%, the dark green coins will be trying to beat that. This is not financial advice. This is merely my personal model, and I am sharing how I utilize it.”</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“We apply time series analysis to investigate the market cycles of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) as well as bitcoin and Ether. Our results show that shocks to ICO volumes are persistent and that shocks in bitcoin and Ether prices have a substantial and positive effect on these volumes – with the effect of bitcoin shocks being of shorter duration than that of Ether shocks. Moreover, higher ICO volumes cause lower bitcoin and Ether prices. Finally, bitcoin shocks positively influence Ether but not the other way round. Our study has implications for financial practice, in particular for cryptocurrency investors and entrepreneurial firms conducting ICOs. June 2018”</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“We estimate the profitability of global index-level trading strategies formed on daily weather across 49 countries. We use ex ante weather information combined with the statistical relationship between daily weather and country index returns to predict index returns on each day. We then form a long-short hedge strategy and a long-only strategy, and find that both strategies generate substantially out-of-sample gross profits. The long-only strategy produces more consistent annualized profits of up to 20.5%, as opposed to a mean world index return of 3.75% during 1993-2012. These findings help solidify the claim that weather exerts economically important impact on mood, and investors can trade profitably on daily weather.”</p>

I think, if we want to predict the return, we can switch all our dimensions (open, high, low, close, volume) to returns — they will be already normalized and this is more suitable option — having our input in form of returns if we plan to forecast return as well:”</p>

Yes, it’s “normal” in deep learning community to take ReLU (or more modern in 2k17 alternative like ELU or SELU) as activation and be happy with this, but we usually don’t think if it’s correct.

Of course having a nice backtesting code allows to build really good strategies with risk management, money management and consider different scenarios, but if you’re researching just signals obtained from different data sources (even it’s just historical prices) with use of machine learning you need something simpler to understand if these signals to go long or short are really useful. Basically we just want to check the difference between prices and multiply it by signal sign — up or down and accumulate this info during test period.”</p>
