</ul>

<p>I‚Äôll be diving deeper into ObCap, Elang, and Agoric over the coming months. In the mean-time, I had a moment to review and create this directory to the Agoric Papers.</p>

<p>At the moment, its pretty simple. I‚Äôve made a link, and chose a selection to quote by the link.</p>

<p>This will allow anyone to quickly review the papers, at a glance. Eventually I‚Äôd like to include related links, and maybe even some images, who knows. :)</p>

<p>Besides that just a little information to familiarize ourselves with the authors.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Often described as ‚Äúthe founding father of nanotechnology‚Äù, Eric Drexler introduced the concept in his seminal 1981 paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which established fundamental principles of molecular engineering and outlined development paths to advanced nanotechnologies. In his 1986 book, Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology, he introduced a broad audience to a fundamental technology objective: using machines that work at the molecular scale to structure matter from the bottom up. Drexler‚Äôs research in this field has been the basis for numerous journal articles and a comprehensive, physics-based analysis in Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing, and Computation. In his publications and lectures, Dr. Drexler describes the implementation and applications of advanced nanotechnologies and shows how they can be used solve, not merely delay, large-scale problems such as global warming.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Like all systems involving goals, resources, and actions, computation can be viewed in economic terms. Computer science has moved from centralized toward increasingly decentralized models of control and action; use of market mechanisms would be a natural extension of this development. The ability of trade and price mechanisms to combine local decisions by diverse parties into globally effective behavior suggests their value for organizing computation in large systems.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This paper examines markets as a model for computation and proposes a framework-agoric systems-for applying the power of market mechanisms to the software domain. It then explores the consequences of this model at a variety of levels. Initial market strategies are outlined which, if used by objects locally, lead to distributed resource allocation algorithms that encourage adaptive modification based on local knowledge. If used as the basis for large, distributed systems, open to the human market, agoric systems can serve as a software publishing and distribution marketplace providing strong incentives for the development of reusable software components. It is argued that such a system should give rise to increasingly intelligent behavior as an emergent property of interactions among software entities and people.</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>This line of investigation leads us to propose what may be called the agoric approach to software systems. Agoric stems from agora, the Greek term for a meeting and market place. An agoric system is defined as a software system using market mechanisms, based on foundations that provide for the encapsulation and communication of information, access, and resources among objects. Each of these notions plays a role in supporting computational markets.</p>

  </li>
  <li><strong>Section 3: Computation and economic order.</strong> - Basic characteristics of human markets illuminate the expected nature of computational markets. This section describes some of these characteristics and sketches some of the special issues raised in the context of computation.</li>
  <li><strong>Section 4: Foundations.</strong> The foundations needed for agoric open systems may be summarized as support for the encapsulation and communication of information, access, and resources. This section describes these foundations and their role in computational markets.</li>
  <li><strong>Section 5:</strong> Agents and strategies. The foundations of computational markets handle neither resource management (such as processor scheduling and garbage collection) nor market transactions. This section describes the idea of business agents and their use both in replacing centralized resource-allocation algorithms (discussed further by [III]) and in managing complex market behavior.</li>
  <li><strong>Section 6:</strong> Agoric systems in the large. Large, evolved agoric systems are expected to have valuable emergent properties. This section describes how they can provide a more productive software market in human society-opening major new business opportunities-and how they can further the goal of artificial intelligence.</li>
  <li><strong>Section 7:</strong> The absence of agoric systems. If market-based computation is a good idea, why has it not yet been developed? This section attempts to show why the current absence of agoric systems is consistent with their being a good idea.</li>
  <li><strong>Appendix I:</strong> Issues, levels, and scale. Agoric open systems will be large and complex, spanning many levels of scale and complexity. This section surveys how issues such as security, reasoning, and trust manifest themselves at different levels of agoric systems.</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Appendix II:</strong> Comparison with other systems. Here are reviewed works ranging from those that draw analogies between human society and computational systems to those that explore adaptive computation from an economic point of view.</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The objects participating in computational markets must initially be much simpler than the human participants in human markets. Can they participate successfully? Human markets are based on intelligent systems, but this does not show the impossibility of basing markets on simple objects-it merely shows that the argument for agoric systems cannot rest on analogy alone. Explicit attention must be paid to the question of the minimal competence and complexity necessary for an object to participate in a market system. (These issues provide another motivation to form computational ‚Äúfirms‚Äù and to open computational markets to human participation.)</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Computational foundations are frequently expressed in the form of programming language or operating system designs. Programming languages have evolved chiefly to provide abstractions for organizing computation on a small scale-the computation occurring inside a single machine and serving a single user. This has unfortunately led many programming lan- guage designers to make decisions (such as providing for global variables or access to arbitrary memory addresses) that make these languages unsuitable for organizing computation on a very large scale. The Actor languages, Argus, the concurrent logic programming languages (such as FCP), and the Mach operating system are examples of systems which have been designed to be extensible to large, open systems. These are covered in this book respectively in [II], [III], [IV], [V], and [VI]. All these projects have arrived at broadly similar models of computation from different directions, suggesting that their common elements will be of general value. This section briefly outlines some of the properties they share-properties which seem important for the implemention of computational markets.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Current resource allocation policies leave much to be desired. One sign of this is that most computing resources-including CPUs, disk heads, local area networks, and much more-sit idle most of the time. But such resources have obvious uses, including improving their own efficiency during later use. For example, heavily-used programs can be recompiled through optimizing compilers or partial evaluators; pages on disk can be rearranged to keep files contiguous; objects can be rearranged according to referencing structure to minimize paging [47], and so forth. In a computational market, a set of unused resources would typically have a zero or near-zero price of use, reflecting only the cost of whatever power consumption or maintenance could be saved by genuine idleness or complete shutdown. Almost any use, however trivial, would then be profitable. In practice, contention for use would bid up prices until they reflected the marginal value of use [5]. Idle time is a blatant sign of wasteful resource allocation policies; one suspects that it is just the tip of a very large iceberg.</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Agoric systems will naturally support a charge-per-use market for software. In any market, software producers will attempt to extract substantial charges from high-volume users. With charge per use, however, the charges to be paid by high-volume users will no longer stand in the way of low-volume users; as a result, they will use expensive software that they could not afford today. At the same time, high-volume users will experience a finite marginal price for using software, rather than buying it and paying a zero marginal price for using it; they will cut back on some of their marginal, low-value uses. The overall benefit of numerous low-volume users making high-value use of the software will likely outweigh the loss associated with a few high-volume users cutting back on their low-value uses, yielding a net social benefit. It seems likely that some of this benefit will appear as increased revenues to software producers, encouraging increased software production.</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why have agoric open systems not been implemented already? In part, because the software community has lacked an immediate, compelling need. Advances have been made, through better programming environments and methodologies (including the encapsulation and communication of information and access), and through tools for making larger structures visible to programmers [64]-all without building markets. These environments and method- ologies have extended the programmer‚Äôs conceptual span of control, enabling one mind or a few closely-coordinated, mutually-trusting minds to build ever larger and more complex programs. These advances have decreased the urgency of enabling extensive cooperation without mutual trust or extensive communications.</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>This paper has examined many of the concrete issues involved in actually creating computational markets, from hardware and software foundations, to initial market strategies for resource management (chiefly in [III]), to the organization of systems of objects and agents able to interact in a market context. As yet, no obstacle to their realization has been found.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Distributed systems based on the charge-per-use sale of software services and computational resources promise a more flexible and effective software market, in which large systems will more often be built from pre-existing parts. With many minds building knowledge and competence into market objects, and with incentives favoring cooperation among these objects, the overall problem-solving ability of the system can be expected to grow rapidly.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>On a small scale, central planning makes sense; on a larger scale, market mechanisms make sense. Computer science began in a domain where central planning made sense, and central planning has thus been traditional. It seems likely, however, that some modern computer systems are already large and diverse enough to benefit from decentralized market coordination. As systems grow in scale and complexity, so will the advantages of market-based computational systems.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This section has examined how a range of issues-security, compatibility, trust, reasoning, and coordination-may appear at different levels of market-based open systems. Certain themes have appeared repeatedly. Mechanisms at low levels often support those at higher levels, as (for example) high-level coordination mechanisms using simple serializers. Further, higher levels can inherit characteristics of lower levels, such as encapsulation and conservation laws.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Issues often blur at the higher levels-security and trust become intertwined, and may both depend on due-process reasoning. The bulk of this paper concentrates on low- and mid-level concerns which must be addressed first, but high-level issues all present a wealth of important research topics.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Xanadu hypertext publishing system This paper has compared agoric systems to other systems for computation. Our first exposure to many of the central ideas of markets and computation, however, stems from our work with the Xanadu hypertext system [23]. Xanadu is a proposed on-line publishing medium for hypertext documents. A hypertext document differs from the normal notion of a document in that it contains links, connections between documents which readers can follow at the click of a mouse. Published documents thus form not a set of disconnected islands, but a web connected by references, quotes, criticisms, comments, and rebuttals.</p>

  <p>How can a reader find a path in such an interconnected web? Rather than proposing that someone (somehow) create a single, official system index, the Xanadu project proposes support for decentralized indexing, and hence for pluralism. Any reader can author and publish a guide to any set of public documents. Other readers can then use this guide to sort material and orient themselves. Anyone can, of course, publish guides to other guides. Xanadu relies on the expectation that this activity will result in a spontaneous order-a richly-connected world of documents in which readers can find their way.</p>

  <p>Why will indexing be done where needed? In part because readers will do much of the basic searching and sorting for themselves, and then publish the results (since publishing is easy). In addition, however, Xanadu provides a charge-per-read royalty arrangement to encourage publication of material for which there is a demand. Just as charge-per-use software will make it economical to assemble software from diverse components, so Xanadu‚Äôs royalty arrangement is designed to encourage the assembly of documents from parts of other documents: if one document quotes another, a reader‚Äôs royalty payments are split between them.</p>

</ul>

<p>Several systems-programming constraints are important in storage management. First, non-garbage-everything reachable by a chain of strong pointers leading from a well-funded object-must not be collected. Second, garbage-everything that is unreferenced and cannot induce other objects to reference or pay it-should eventually be collected. Finally, overhead costs should be reasonable: bookkeeping storage per object should be bounded and the computational burden of the algorithms should scale roughly linearly (at most) with the number of objects.</p>

  <p>This section describes initial market strategies for both sellers and buyers. In processor scheduling, we will term the time-seller (or agent for the seller) an auction house, and a time-buyer (or agent for a buyer) a bidder. A system may have any number of competing sellers.</p>

  <p>Many of the above algorithms make strategic sense only if one object can trust another object to follow them. For example, there are direct financial incentives to embezzle funds or misreport earnings by violating the dividend algorithm, and there are market-share incentives to produce falsely low cost estimates by violating the base-demand algorithm. Further, improper market intelligence (who is using what services?) can be gleaned by comparing alert- ID values arriving via different consultants. Thus, one needs what may be called initial strategies for trust.</p>

  <p>As noted in the discussion of accounting overhead in the dividend algorithm, the incentive structure of an algorithm (in the absence of risk aversion) is determined by its average expected payoffs, which can deviate from its actual payoffs on any given occasion.

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>This paper has explored mechanisms for the allocation of processor time and storage that are compatible both with programming practice and with market mechanisms. Processor scheduling through an auction process yields a flexible, decentralized priority system, allowing a variety of strategies that make tradeoffs involving the speed, certainty, and cost of service. Storage can be managed through auctioning of rental space and decentralized networks of client-consultant relationships. This yields a distributed garbage collection algorithm able both to collect unreferenced loops that cross trust boundaries and to accumulate rough price information to guide economic decisions regarding, for example, local caching in distributed systems.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some of these algorithms (e.g., for processor scheduling) have per-decision costs comparable to those of non-market mechanisms in current use; others have costs that are much greater. In general, these costs will be acceptable for objects of sufficient size and processes of sufficient duration.</p>

  <p>The alert algorithm is the most procedurally intricate of the initial strategies described here, hence it is the one least suited to description in English.

<blockquote>
  <p>The Axelrod tournament Robert Axelrod developed an ecosystem in which the entities interact in rounds of iterated prisoner‚Äôs dilemma games [5]. To understand it, one must first understand the dilemma itself. Instead of the traditional scenario of prisoners being interrogated, Hofstadter‚Äôs illustration with the following scenario seems more intuitive.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two dealers arrange to trade items. Each dealer agrees to place his item in a bag and leave it at a designated place to be retrieved by the other dealer. The dilemma presents itself when each dealer considers how best to interact with the other-given that they are strangers, will not meet face to face for this exchange, and will never deal with each other in the future. As Hofstadter describes, each dealer reasons as follows:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚Äú`If the [other] dealer brings a full bag, I‚Äôll be better off having left an empty bag, because I‚Äôll have gotten all that I wanted and given away nothing. If the dealer brings an empty bag, I‚Äôll be better off having left an empty bag, because I‚Äôll not have been cheated. I‚Äôll have gained nothing but lost nothing either. Thus it seems that no matter what the dealer chooses to do, I‚Äôm better off leaving an empty bag. So I‚Äôll leave an empty bag.‚Äô . . .And so both of you, with your impeccable (or impeccable-seeming) logic, leave empty bags, and go away empty handed. How sad, for if you both had just cooperated, you could have each gained something you wanted to have. Does logic prevent cooperation? This is the issue of the Prisoner‚Äôs Dilemma.‚Äù [emphasis in the original] [9]</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The underlying strategic situation can be made precise in the following fashion: In a single prisoner‚Äôs dilemma interaction, two players each choose between moves (termed cooperate and defect) in ignorance of the other‚Äôs choice. If both cooperate, both are rewarded (in Axelrod‚Äôs case, with a payoff of 3 points). If one cooperates and the other defects, the defector receives an even greater reward (5 points), while the cooperator receives nothing (0 points). If both defect, both are punished (by receiving only 1 point).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a single move, each player has an incentive to defect regardless of the other player‚Äôs move, but double-cooperation is better than double-defection. Overall, pairs of players that cooperate earn higher scores than those that do not.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In an iterated prisoner‚Äôs dilemma game, two players go through a long series of moves, and can base their actions on the history of play. When one expects (and hopes for) further transactions with the other party, simple defection no longer seems as attractive. Indeed, by running a computer tournament, Axelrod showed that the logic of an iterated prisoner‚Äôs dilemma actually fosters cooperation.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Robert Axelrod ran a Computer Prisoner‚Äôs Dilemma Tournament based on the above rules. A diverse group of game theorists were invited to submit programs to play against each other in a round-robin of games, each averaging 200 single moves. After the first tournament, Axelrod circulated the results-including the nature of the winning program, judged by cumulative points-and solicited entries for a second tournament.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Axelrod‚Äôs pair of tournaments may be described as a simple evolutionary ecosystem. The replicators were the programs themselves (or the strategies those programs embody), the variation mechanism was human ingenuity (since programs were modified between tournaments), and the selection criterion during a tournament was simply the number of points earned. Programs interacted with each other in an environment imposing certain rules, and their success depended on each others‚Äô behavior. Further, Axelrod went on to simulate the population dynamics of a set of programs, given the assumption that points earned determined the ‚Äúpopulation density‚Äù of that program in the next time period.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In both tournaments a very simple program won. That program was TIT FOR TAT, submitted by psychologist Anatol Rapoport. In the population dynamics simulation, the success of TIT FOR TAT was even more pronounced. Analyzing TIT FOR TAT‚Äôs success can suggest how to analyze other ecosystems.</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>A single population-dynamics process can be described as an ecosystem, but not as an evolutionary ecosystem, since there is no source of variation. Axelrod‚Äôs series of two tournaments included variation from one to the next, and hence qualifies. To transform it into a better example of an evolutionary ecosystem, imagine a continuing tournament open to outside contestants able to create new strategies and introduce them in small numbers. In any such open, evolving ecosystem, given no special restrictions on allowable variations, one should expect the ecosystem to become populated primarily by an ESS. The properties of such an ESS will often indicate emergent properties of the system. For example, in any open Axelrod ecosystem most moves will be cooperative.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The above discussion of Axelrod‚Äôs system benefits from hindsight. The original game-theory experts who submitted the original strategies knew the rules, and those who submitted strategies for the second tournament even had the benefit of a bit of hindsight from the first tournament. Nevertheless, in both cases most of the strategies submitted were not nice, and so were not ESSs. The analyses which follow cover much more complex ecosystems, in which the nature of strategies and payoffs are much more subtle.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Biological and market ecosystems both contain a mixture of symbiotic and negative-sum relationships. This paper argues that biological ecosystems involve more predation, while idealized market ecosystems involve more symbiosis. Indeed, one can make a case that this is so even for human market ecosystems-that biological ecosystems are, overall, dominated by predation, while market ecosystems are, overall, dominated by symbiosis.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In human markets (as in idealized markets) producers within an industry compete, but chains of symbiotic trade connect industry to industry. Competition in biology likewise occurs most often among those occupying the same niche, but here, it is predation that connects from niche to niche. Because of the lack of reputations and trademarks, symbiosis in biology occurs most often in situations where the ‚Äúplayers‚Äù find themselves in a highly-iterated game. In the extreme, the symbiotic system itself becomes so tightly woven that it is considered a single organism-as with lichens composed of fungi and algae, or animals composed of eukaryotic cells containing mitochondria. Predation, of course, links one symbiotic island to the next.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lenat‚Äôs EURISKO system [6] may be viewed as an ecosystem in which the replicators are interacting, evolving heuristics-that is, evolving, computational rules of thumb. Two kinds of heuristics populate EURISKO: object-level heuristics whose subject domain is some topic to be explored (such as war games or three-dimensional VLSI), and meta-heuristics whose subject domain is heuristics. Variation occurs as meta-heuristics create new heuristics from old ones via mutation, and selection occurs as meta-heuristics judge and determine the ‚Äúinterestingness‚Äù of heuristics (a numeric value associated with a heuristic). This quantity determines allocation of processing resources, so heuristics compete for survival and influence based on their degree of ‚Äúinterestingness‚Äù.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Human cultures evolve. Their replicators are any of the information patterns which make up a culture, and which spread (with variation) from human to human via imitation. By analogy with genes, these replicators are known as memes [7]; they include ideas, beliefs, habits, morals, fashions, designs, techniques, jokes, and more. Any pattern which can spread via imitation is a meme, even if its human host cannot articulate it or is unaware of its existence.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is important to recognize that the replicators of human culture are memes, not people. The lack of this distinction has led to the unfortunate confusion called ‚Äúsocial darwinism‚Äù. Our ability to change our minds allows cultural evolution to proceed not by selection of humans, but, as Karl Popper says, by ‚Äúletting our theories die in our stead‚Äù [4].</p>

  <p>Although evolutionary reasoning is most often applied to biological ecosystems, it is also of use in understanding human markets, culture, and politics, and adaptive computational systems such as EURISKO. By assuming that an ecosystem‚Äôs foundational rules will shape its evolutionarily stable strategies, and that these strategies will dominate behavior in the ecosystem, one can relate foundations to emergent properties-including properties sought by a designer. This paper has examined a variety of evolutionary ecosystems and compared them with ‚Äúdirect, idealized-market ecosystems‚Äù; for the purpose of evolving useful computational behavior, the latter have strong advantages. Other papers in this volume explore the implementation and properties of computational markets of this sort in greater depth [I,II].</p>
