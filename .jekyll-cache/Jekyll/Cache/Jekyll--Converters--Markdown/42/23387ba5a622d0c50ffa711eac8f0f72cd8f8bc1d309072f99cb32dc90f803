I"œ<p>Iâ€™m taking a step back from social media, so I can focus better on creating informative resources, and curated collections.</p>

<p>If youâ€™d like an e-mail for site updates and major announcements, you can subscribe here.</p>

<p>I wonâ€™t sell your information, or even send many e-mails.</p>

<p>Eventually, I might experient with a monthly newsletter with an occasional promotional offer. However, that would be a distinct opt-in list.</p>
