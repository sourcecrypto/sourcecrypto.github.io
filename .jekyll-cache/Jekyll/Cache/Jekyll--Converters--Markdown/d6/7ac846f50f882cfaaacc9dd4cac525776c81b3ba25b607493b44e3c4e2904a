<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>[Music]
hello hello hello hello welcome to Insureblocks, your dedicated podcast to blockchain and smart contracts in the
insurance industry. Iâ€™m Walid Al Saqqaf, your host. this week we have a very special podcast today. weâ€™re going to be debating the public vs private blockchain for enterprises and weâ€™re very lucky to have to thought leaders or as John would put it Jutta masters and Iâ€™m very pleased to have returning to Insureblocks Richard Brown chief technology officer R3 and for the first time John walpert senior product executive at
consensus.</p>

<p>[ â€¦snipâ€¦ ]</p>

<p>thank you very much so to provide some context on the purpose of this debate podcast it kind of all started when a consensus article was written on the 3rd of January 2019 entitled quote busting the myths of private blockchains and close quote on the 14th of January Richard Brown posted a counter-argument entitled busting the myths of public blockchains for business and Insureblocks produce a podcast regarding that blog post along through Richard and the 23rd of January John walpert wrote back an article called these errand the enterprise blockchains youâ€™re looking for.</p>

<p><strong>in five minutes could you please each present your main arguments on why you believe your public or private blockchain is more suitable for enterprises.</strong></p>

<h3 id="richard">Richard</h3>

<p>â€¦and you have five minutes:</p>

<p><em>So weâ€™re going to get onto the specific point raised in the articles a bit later so maybe Iâ€™ll start here with almost the take you on the journey we went on when we designed Corda you think about where weâ€™ll be whereas in the world three or four years ago it was a pretty brave possibly people might think particularly mad idea to to build a new blockchain platform from scratch when there are so many already in existence.</em></p>

<p><em>The reason we did it is hopefully is interesting and maybe directive for your audience so our starting point was what would be possible what would the world be like if I could have my system or in a cloud system thatâ€™s under my control what the world be like give if I could be if I could know if I could be sure that when it tells me some things about deals Iâ€™ve done with my counterparts or if money Iâ€™ve lent or borrowed or any kind of fact I care about if I could know for sure that what it told me was the same as what my counterparts or my competitors computer told them clearly</em></p>

<p><em>if I had that kind of ability it would probably dramatically reduce costs complexity risk duplication all these opportunities for things to go wrong would be eliminated all this reconciliation we do which suddenly revealed the right answer rather than the wrong answer.</em></p>

<p><em>but it would go further than that if I knew for sure that the data I was running my business on was in sync with my counterparts and therefore was correct just think how more quickly I could make decisions how more how more quickly assets could move how more quickly deals could be done because I wouldnâ€™t first have to go through this endless process of checking to make sure that I was operating on correct information</em></p>

<p><em>so we started almost from the solution doesnâ€™t domain back to the requirements domain and said if I had this requirement for a platform that allowed me to build applications that were in sync by design with all the other people running the application how would I do that what would a platform that allowed you to do that need to look like how would it work?</em></p>

<p><em>and a few things sort of emerged from that the platform would need an identity model. if I was trying to model the fact that Iâ€™d lent some money to Willy door heâ€™d lent some money to me when when I send that data to him to get him to sign it to say yes we agree this deal is correct I need to know itâ€™s actually going to him and not somebody else. so there needs to be this this this first-class concept of identity at the heart of the platform so I know with whom Iâ€™m transacting.</em></p>

<p><em>Iâ€™d also need some notion of privacy is the fact that Iâ€™ve entered into a deal with Lalit well why should Jon know about that or anomaly dive entered into a deal why should I know about it so it kind of felt like privacy and an information only going to those who need it should be a foundational concept not something that we we add on at the end so we knew that not sending data to everybody was was a kind of like a non-negotiable requirement</em></p>

<p><em>now that easy to say but it was highly controversial at the time if I remember sitting down with the architecture working group and many of the other participants in our process at that time and it almost felt like I was new I was I was slaughtering these sacrificial lambs. I was saying things you think are innate in blockchain we have to question them to to to achieve our ends because what that leads to is probably an architecture and itâ€™s the one we ended up with the urban Corda and in an architecture where messages and data are broadcast or gossip to the entire network but instead theyâ€™re sent just to those who need to have them</em></p>

<p><em>now as John will probably drill into a bit later need to know is quite a subtle concept so I donâ€™t want a gloss over that but that the high level the idea is the data just goes to those who need to check that somethingâ€™s correct and people who are not parties to the deal and donâ€™t care about it shouldnâ€™t get to see it and then you go on and you say well if Iâ€™m trying to enable people to run their businesses more efficiently and then from that more efficient platform then be able to do do new things and take new opportunities</em></p>

<p><em>I have to think about the people who were building these applications they have to be able to do it in in languages they understand in languages like Java Scala currently in any kind of modern high-level language the business people I know tens of millions of a business programmers know how to use the platform has to be scalable we have to be able to process huge numbers of transactions and perhaps perhaps most critically and this is a point I got onto in my article if weâ€™re dealing with business transactions were real moneyâ€™s at stake and weâ€™re but were whether Iâ€™ve paid will lead back or I havenâ€™t or he hasnâ€™t paid me back or whether somethingâ€™s happened or not is something we care about we need finality we need to know that when when we believe something has been done it canâ€™t become undone.</em></p>

<p><em>so the idea is weâ€™re with Corda, and what we are trying to achieve with it is you can build business applications that keep counterparts and participants in sync they can do so in languages they understand in a way that gives them privacy in a way that gives them certainty that when they think something is done it really is done and thatâ€™s thatâ€™s what weâ€™ve been building itâ€™s itâ€™s growing massively people are really embracing it and Iâ€™ve been really pleased with just how fast itâ€™s grown as an open source community</em></p>

<p>excellent thank you very much Richard.</p>

<h3 id="john">John</h3>

<p>â€¦youâ€™ve got five minutes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>so should go back in time to 2015 when I was trying to convince Richard to stay at IBM desperately I think I even offered you my job, didnâ€™t I? I said Richard this is your chance to change the Internet, then Richard said thatâ€™s what you want to do John. what I wanted to do is his work is really influenced the world of finance and make a mark there so I know it was a good lesson in intent right and I think Corda is a beautiful approach to that intent writing at work, works on Finance and I see the evolution of that now itâ€™s looking at Iâ€™ve heard the phrase the Internet of Corte</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>so maybe weâ€™re converging, and the point is that back in 2015, I my team and I embarked on creating  Hyperledger Fabric Richard when created Corda and with their team I do think it was a missed opportunity because an open source we probably could have been more in the same repo competing coming up with something that worked for everyone back in those days but yeah in those days we decided both of us I think Richard keep me honest here that we started with things like Ethereum and we loved it and that public Ethereum community really had some things that it needed to work on like scaling and we were focused on things like peer-to-peer channels that can can have a lot of confidence, Iâ€™ll simply say privacy, but confidentiality that is not only it can mature the transactions not be seen by parties that are not counted that are not involved in the in the transaction but the business logic should not be executed on on every node in the network even if itâ€™s a private network</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Iâ€™ve been saying that blockchain is a nudist colony and the only difference between private and public blockchain is whether or not youâ€™re naked on a private beach or a public beach but either way people are gonna see your private parts and thatâ€™s not ok if even if youâ€™re in a group say in a supply chain network or an insurance network that insurance in particular there are a lot of agreements between party and party B that cannot be seen by party see the logic itself behind the agreement the existence of the logic cannot be known to party see this often occurs in health care Richard would you agree?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>totally I mean just making some notes as you were saying and the if it was go back to the comment you made about when we were both both at IBM and you write at the time as I said in my intro R3 was very much a finance orientated consortium and itâ€™s kind of ironic, I call it serendipitous usually but it is also ironic that I went down that path thinking I was building a blockchain for finance and then woke up probably about probably about 18 months ago to realize that I didnâ€™t advertently built a general purpose platform instead Brian rug who leads our insurance industry sheâ€™s based in New York which is actually in London this week and will lead knows her well I remember her coming up to me shortly after we hired her maybe two years ago now I was saying Richard you donâ€™t realize you keep talking about banking but you were built the best platform for insurance and I said yeah yes stop flattering me that and focus on banks and but itâ€™s a there was this probably hasnâ€™t been revealed externally there was there was a big internal debate because it took it to itâ€™s anything me cuz Iâ€™m often blinkered took me it took me a while to realize that what we had built something that was more general-purpose than weâ€™d expected and we were actually doing certainly ourselves but also the community disservice by constantly talking about it in financial terms because we were inadvertently signaling to other people in other industries itâ€™s itâ€™s not for you if youâ€™re not a bank when actually as weâ€™re now seeing in in health care insurance trade finance supply chain you everywhere weâ€™re seeing it get adopted but um but but youâ€™re right you join a we joke but but it genuinely wasnâ€™t the original intent</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I should probably say for the record here I have been always have been my inception into blockchain was with Richard and that I am a Gendalian Iâ€™ve been Iâ€™ve been making fun of Richard by calling it the Gendalian architecture and the Gendalian architecture is basically the assertion, and I agree with it, that parties that are not counterparty to an agreement should not neither execute the code of that agreement nor even know about it nor store the state transitions of that agreement and so I think we agree on that right yeah totally totally and you clearly are public watching thatâ€™s an interesting unto itself I think my case here is not about is not about whether private or public actually I believe that the emperor has no clothes in both private and public that either one of them is insufficient to the task of evolving the Internet and that what we need is to go from this divergence that we needed to do in 2015 now toward back towards convergence and I wish I could just find all the humans and take off their flags and make them forget they ever had them and start to work in open source on saying okay well that idea in Corda was pretty good idea bad idea in Fabric was a good idea that idea in theory emits a good idea</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>how do I make these things work together in a in something that looks more like a seamless protocol so that we donâ€™t have a balkanized slagheap of of a mess going forward yeah I think we can also agree that given the traction that Fabric has been having, and also Ethereum, that the world isnâ€™t going to be an Internet of Corda unless something radically changesâ€¦ so itâ€™s gonna weâ€™re gonna have to work together right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[ â€¦snipâ€¦ ]</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My point was if you if you get a deploy whether itâ€™s itâ€™s so different deployments of Fabric or different deployments of Corda or one of the enterprise Ethereum variants even if youâ€™re deploying it for one purpose with sort of supply chain or insurance if you can agree as a group unless is that almost as a community up front to some common identity standards common governance common protocol rules - in the way the public Bitcoin network does, and in the way the public Ethereum network does.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>the opportunities for interoperability within that shared network are so much greater because youâ€™ve pre agreed your pre committed to so much and in effect and of course this is what makes it hard youâ€™ve youâ€™ve deliberately upfront really relinquished your right to deviate from certain things in order to maximize the chances of interrupt.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>what the public in Topeka Ethereum Network has achieved multiple different applications on the same network we should strive and aspire to do the same thing with the with the enterprise block chains with whether itâ€™s about brakes or tooth Corda and we shouldnâ€™t deploy them as standalone states</p>
</blockquote>

<p>actually thatâ€™s I had read that part of your writings and that makes a lot of sense to me in in a way that I hadnâ€™t really apprehended before so thanks for that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>but the notion hope though is yeah when people talk about security I find that theyâ€™re theyâ€™re thinking data breaches Frank what happens to companies like Facebook and others when when we find out about these breaches or these misuse of data but really the security is two things right thereâ€™s tamper resistance and thereâ€™s surveillance resistance for debut avoidance of data breaches right now you want to and of course a private blockchain certainly Fabric style and Iâ€™m starting to really rethink my point of view about Fabric that I like to Fabric channels for a while but the more I dig Richard into the corridor model and like Clement Swan is is pretty knowledgeable about it Iâ€™ve been talking a lot about this and also other people from hope we have a lot of knowledge about coordinate is that it Cordas flow system is a lot more neural plastic and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>as a product guy which I used to be a CEO and when youâ€™re not a CEO youâ€™re a product guy so if you had I know a few things about the code but I think of myself more as a product person so what are the requirements right my requirement is I should be able to find you a registrar preferably a public permanent registrar right one that isnâ€™t controlled by any group of companies or canâ€™t be Jack taking control of by some oligopoly right that public registrar basically an improvement in DNS will put you and me together in a very very very private thing that we can be confident isnâ€™t be jacked and duped by anybody else and weâ€™re gonna conduct some business logic Iâ€™ll give you three cookies for four donuts but if on Thursday at noon youâ€™ll give me five cookies Iâ€™ll give you Iâ€™ll give you twelve cookies if LIBOR goes over twenty percent we can make all these rules right and those rules should be known only to you and me</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>but the problem with that is that state machine then under traditional techniques is very mutable right weak you could chamfer with the code or I could tamper with the code or the administrator at the on the on the measure or AWS or what have you node or a host will can tamper with it or throw something in between the hypervisor and the stack and sniff out our information right so I want that bilateral or multilateral relationship to be just between you and me but I want it to be a be immutable canâ€™t be tampered with and I sometimes in fact Iâ€™m working on a project right now in aerospace where that needs to be military-grade Trent tamper resistance and last checked there is no such thing in private that looks like military-grade tamper resistance</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>the closest thing we have to that the gold standard is a large globally distributed public main net now the problem with that is that the public main that has no surveillance resistance everything is done by everybody and you donâ€™t even know who those people are so I think wouldnâ€™t we agree that horses for courses as they say in Australia the right tool for the right job I want to do as little business logic and actual point-to-point communications on a main net a public main that is possible but I want if I can to get these these state channels these little these little state machines between you and me or you and me and a bunch of other people to be as tamper-resistant as possible while also being surveillance resistant but then then this is the last problem is Iâ€™m going to need if Iâ€™m a good programmer to pass parameters and to send into to return stuff from functions on my little state machine and send those two as parameters to functions on other peopleâ€™s state machines and how do you do that without a common root core machine</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[ â€¦snipâ€¦ ]</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>well lead weâ€™re not weâ€™re not buying cars here right weâ€™re talking about open source protocol level not even house plumbing weâ€™re talking about in the street plumbing right and just having to choose Fabric versus kurta thatâ€™s a sad conversation to have but we should be talking about is okay my business Iâ€™ll give you an example Iâ€™ve got a we just released something called bootleg yeah which is a really cool application and it allows royalty itâ€™s basically a royalty sharing Platteville assistant and for musicians or even oil and gas and it could be insurance where anywhere where I have to share realties according to a royalty distribution formula for future cash flows that are coming in to some kind of an application or system in that in that application if Iâ€™m a music studio thereâ€™s no way I want the royalties that I am receiving from these cash flows people buying these these these videos or these music copies to for people I shouldnâ€™t my competitor shouldnâ€™t know what Iâ€™m taking in that royalty right and if you put it on a public blockchain you would youâ€™d be in a nudist colony people would know they would see it in the logic that could decompile the smart contract if itâ€™s in a private blockchain like Fabric if youâ€™re all in the same channel same problem what court is cool great about is that it is really fundamentally point-to-point but then it has other issues with sharing state right so if I want to share a flow from kurta from a couple of parties in kurta to something thatâ€™s working on a theory a more on Bitcoin or what have you then I then Iâ€™m gonna have to deal with that right and thatâ€™s the problem there</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>so the what I really want is to be able to have shared state on a public network that says yeah we all have this royalty token but their business rules for who gets what in that royalty scheme need to be done on a point-to-point basis what I really want to be able to do is push some logic down into a Corda network to run that logic and then have that return to the to the main net with the shared state result right that way I have privacy and I think much more importantly confidentiality along with global military-grade tamper resistance and Iâ€™m really curious Richard to see what you think about how we could make that work so Corda and Ethereum can work seamlessly together in a stateful internet way</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="richard-1">Richard</h3>

<p><em>itâ€™s yeah itâ€™s itâ€™s really good to hear you describe it that way John because if I go back a few minutes to what youâ€™re talking about which I think you summarized at the end you it youâ€™re talking in terms of tamper resistance and surveillance resistance and I donâ€™t tend to always always think or speak in those terms but but I think itâ€™s quite helpful. so if Iâ€™m transacting with you then the only people who should know about it are people who have a right to know and that was kind of like a foundational requirement against which we engineered Corda so I agree with that.</em></p>

<p><em>weâ€™re trying weâ€™re trying to tease out differences in areas of agreement in this podcast so Iâ€™m not trying to pick a fight but but there is a but I think where tamper resistance is itâ€™s probably where we may disagree because of course and the thicknesses think something that people sometimes sometimes miss totally point to who will come into this quite quiet down position of novelty because none of these platforms are actually tamper resistant the data resides on peopleâ€™s computers human beings who own computers have got data on their computers thereâ€™s nothing to stop me going into my computer and changing any piece of data on it I want just as thereâ€™s nothing stopping Willy changing data on his computer nothing stopping John changing data on his I think the requirement we actually have visit guess is almost tamper-evident so that if I try to convince you something is correct you are able to detect if the if the presumptions or the inputs if you like that Iâ€™m relying on for my argument have been changed or arenâ€™t pre-agreed then you can spot that and therefore know that Iâ€™m trying to trick you and that for the listeners this is this is an important point because all these blockchain systems whether itâ€™s called a Fabric Ethereum, and whatever it is that kind of like that kind of like logic engines that based on almost like inductive logic for those of you who remember your maths lessons back at school everything you want to do it is almost almost like that the grammar the language of everything that happens on it is</em></p>

<p><em>I want to convince you that you now owe me this much money and you will be in no position to deny it because Iâ€™m going to do the following thing Iâ€™m gonna say the last thing we agreed on is this and Iâ€™m gonna prove we agreed on it either because it was signed by lots of miners signed by a notary pool whatever it is but this is the last thing we agreed on pair the rules weâ€™ve already agreed to know the contract weâ€™ve already signed the code youâ€™ve already signed up to here is some new evidence or some new data and per those rules this is the proof that I can now change that previous fact that previous deal into something else and because we pre agreed what the rules were would pre agreed what evidence needed to be provided and we had a shared understanding of what the previous state was and what the previous fact was we can each evaluate that and weâ€™ll both reach the same answer and one weâ€™re temporal resistance</em></p>

<p><em>I saw that with EDI can do that with with any often say if you could bass you can sass right I mean if you can if you could have a blockchain as a service and you can have a you could just probably youâ€™re happy as long as you can call it blockchain so you can get funded because thatâ€™s where weâ€™re at right now but but if if you can call it an Oracle a nice traditional Oracle database I donâ€™t mean Oracleâ€™s I mean Oracle as Iâ€™m Larry Ellison Oracle database or the cloud implementation but if you can call it blockchain but use a traditional system very often I think thatâ€™s probably just fine right because what people really want is to be able to collaborate we really been able to collaborate for most of my 30 years in business itâ€™s just that we really havenâ€™t prioritized that is whatâ€™s a new so okay so this would thatâ€™s exactly so thatâ€™s exactly the point</em></p>

<p><em>to get back on to how in that scenario I just described how could I do fraud well how can I convince him of something thatâ€™s not true but make him think it is true and itâ€™s backed itâ€™s back to that temper resistance or tamper-evident piece if it was just a database in the cloud if I could hack into that or I could persuade the operator to change something well these would have no way of evident excuse me no way of evidencing that the thing that was different with blockchain on this achieved in different ways with different trade-offs between proof of work log chains and notarized block chains or depending on how you want to call them is how do we establish what the previous state was what needs to have been signed what needs to have been minds or notarized or whatever it is so that if I try and say - weâ€™ll eat hereâ€™s what we previously agreed and hereâ€™s the update what do we need to have agreed up front so that when I say that to him he could say hang on that isnâ€™t what we previously agreed and here is the proof that we actually agreed something else where is the stamp that says the previous confirmed transaction was X and the point I was trying to make it youâ€™re not worth know we can do that in many different ways you can use cloud do you yeah yeah</em></p>

<p><em>that was a point of my blog post which was proof of work blockchains the way they achieve that is by saying the most that the largest number of miners have been effectively voted on that previous history and because we believe and this is where the belief piece coming in because we believe the mining pool the number of miners mining the etherion blockchain of the Bitcoin blockchain is is mostly honest and highly diverse itâ€™s unlikely that they would be feeding a false history to me and Iâ€™d come on to some of the pros and cons of that an alternative and this is the one that through through this lengthy conversation with me all the firmâ€™s we built Corda with or as they said what thereâ€™s the probabilistic element of that the fact that history could be could be reversed slightly and things you thought were agreed become an agreed because you donâ€™t actually know who is signing or mining these transactions you donâ€™t know whether the probabilistic</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>yes yeah yeah but you again we both know this Richard that the laws of physics do not allow for instant or fast finality or one block finality systems to scale to massive numbers of eyeballs right you can R be up to your pbft they have very serious limitations now you get around that by just basically being almost a message bus protocol right youâ€™re youâ€™re youâ€™re youâ€™re just going point-to-point shared state is more challenging for a court of the opposite problem for Corte shared states easy for a public network shared state for court is a little harder itâ€™s not impossible but harder point two points really hard for a public network in fact virtually impossible but having shared state is easier and so again itâ€™s horse itâ€™s itâ€™s right tool for the right shoulder</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I mean youâ€™re going to have the ultimate notary why should why wouldnâ€™t we make the ultimate notary a notary of notaries a basically a table of pinning contracts the Ethereum main-net thatâ€™s my point right so that we can have our cake and eat it too is it where we can have this beautiful private state machine where for a couple of parties itâ€™s kind of okay that itâ€™s theoretically yes you have evident you could you could say that itâ€™s not just do no evil but do we you can do evil but Iâ€™m gonna find out quickly that you did evil and that might be okay for a couple of parties but weâ€™re talking when weâ€™re talking about the internet of transactions being possibly every transaction you cannot leave the ultimate vanishing point of control in the hands of a group of companies or governments or any other group right you need that vanishing point to be as decentralized and politically outside of the realm of politics as possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="richard-2">Richard</h3>

<p><em>I do Iâ€™d agree with that but it would be it would be a more powerful argument if if letâ€™s take Bitcoin letâ€™s take the letâ€™s talk about a different platform if if this supposedly highly decentralized confirmation process on one of them on the worldâ€™s largest block chain network weâ€™re not we believe in the hands of three four five huge huge firms in China so thereâ€™s thereâ€™s theory under the ideal and then thereâ€™s the practical reality and the implications of the economics so they should do it nobody knows itâ€™s mining</em></p>

<p><em>so the very specific point Iâ€™m making because it was kind of like the heart of my sa view like was this whole blockchain edifice this hot certainly in the business base this whole edifice that I can convince you that what you see is what I see without having to go through all this endless reconciliation it rests on us being sure about what it takes for the previous faction to previous second the Lord stood we previous step in the logic to have been confirmed how do I know something wonâ€™t be undone just finish the point so thereâ€™s so thereâ€™s and thereâ€™s fundamentally two ways of doing it you either go with the effectively what amounts to the proof of work and then the proof of stake approaching in Bitcoin or Ethereum which is just as an aside is no it is it was a jaw-droppingly amazing advance in computer science</em></p>

<p><em>when I first read it and got my head around it it was amazing and it has the potential to give you that decentralization you talk about and to avoid being beholden to any small number of firms but the practical reality of the empirical evidence of the last ten years is it hasnâ€™t yet worked out that way in reality is controlled by a very small number of parties who nobody has any governance control over and the cost that comes with that through energy usage and the possibility of reversal through probabilistic finality makes it highly just highly difficult so the alternative approach and Iâ€™m not saying itâ€™s appropriate for everybody is to say what this is hard the probabilistic piece is hard to deal with the fact that we donâ€™t know whoâ€™s providing this consensus is very very trouble trouble some from many business use cases so why instead donâ€™t we say what letâ€™s let us surface this itâ€™s actually make it explicit who are the five seven nine organizations who who are who are providing this consensus service how are they selected how are they governed. how are they overseen how many of them have to collude weâ€™ll go bad in order for a problem to occur and little and then then that may then let people make business decisions about the extent to which theyâ€™re willing to trust them and the extent to which theyâ€™re willing to to run business transactions that so Iâ€™m not saying either is perfect but we shouldnâ€™t I donâ€™t want the listeners to believe that the decentralization of networks like a Ethereum a Bitcoin also Maps down to the decentralization of consensus forming power because it doesnâ€™t it the economics makes it highly concentrated and all oligopolistic but with zero transparency well</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>so first of all when you and I were both hanging out together a few years ago yeah we both loved where where the public network was going and as I said the mining you can I look I sty I was one of the cofounders of Fabric and Hyperledger I definitely was in that camp I used to say things like what you just said and now Iâ€™ve learned I was pretty happy back at IBM why did I come over to to consensus well because again Iâ€™m not more interested in internet style application building rather than the hell of building consortium.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Iâ€™ve spent him a good chunk of my last 30 years trying to build heavy-handed business consortium and blockchain or no blockchain, distributed ledger no distributed ledger it is a mess and hard to do but if we can say nope I can itâ€™s the Internetâ€™s too but we all have control that none of us has in control of the system truly right and show me a blockchain business, a blockchain as a service network that doesnâ€™t have a hegemon calling the shots getting everybody together and having a strong hegemonic control over that network I have not seen it yet and Iâ€™ve not seen any blockchain as a service network that has actually given their administrative keys over to the participants except one CLS right and that and thatâ€™s why I was on the record saying CLS was a really good example of using private watching because those parties would not have worked together if they didnâ€™t they werenâ€™t able to say that each of them had their own control their own nodes or their peers in this case</p>

  <p>so I think thatâ€™s thatâ€™s right but Iâ€™m more of a guess and on this that again I would not put the crypto kitties in the future for example for people that know crypto kitties which is a popular game is not gonna be on a public main net itâ€™s gonna be on a side network like me maybe something more like Gordo or more like Fabric or more like an ethereal side chain youâ€™re not gonna put those things on the main net it youâ€™ve just it if if the whole world was doing that one ledger is not big enough to do that but one ledger is big enough to coordinate the other ledgers and this sounds like the one ring to the rule of them all kind of story but honestly if weâ€™re not going to have a giant mess in a battle at the gates of border over or whose protocols more important and rather say ever all the protocols have different benefits for different use cases but they need to be able to pass parameters to each other without getting into deadlocks and race conditions then they need a coordinating route chain one thatâ€™s running pinning contracts and I see that at the Ethereum main that is the way to do that so maybe this thing</p>

  <p>well Iâ€™ve done Iâ€™ve got this result and now Iâ€™m gonna pass that result of these other things and Iâ€™m gonna wait until this block and two two before Iâ€™m gonna reset myself to my original state you canâ€™t do that unless you have a common frame of reference</p>

<p><em>so maybe maybe I donâ€™t want to go too far too far away from from elite audience but maybe thereâ€™s a place we canâ€™t agree them which is if because you isnâ€™t you made to you made to argue my limit to the two pieces your argument there John, which I agree and one I didnâ€™t one was it wouldnâ€™t it be great if there were some some service somewhere some decentralized service to which I could throw a transaction of any form code or Ethereum whatever to which I can throw a transaction and this is some validation to make sure that the wrong the bad ones get get filtered out and then at some point later Iâ€™m told that thing is now confirmed everybody in the world who needs to know nodes but no itâ€™s been confirmed and it can never be undone and thereâ€™s nobody who can exert undue power over that so we know itâ€™s truly beyond that consensus forming process and the inability to reverse it is beyond the power of its probabilities</em></p>

<p><em>and I should I should I should hasten to add though that also that that level should be extremely constrained right thatâ€™s not something that you do for everything most business logic should be gone done quite a point Iâ€™m sure no surely I wasnâ€™t I was I was simplifying even further or saying if if if if someone had one of those for me Iâ€™m a buyer if I had something to which I could throw transaction and it came back completely confirmed with no chance of reversal and there was nobody I didnâ€™t need to know whoâ€™s running a pad but I knew that they couldnâ€™t subvert it I would be a buyer of that</em></p>

<p><em>where I disagree to the argument was you then made a logical leap which was to say itâ€™s itâ€™s the Ethereum network as it currently exists and my org how does a girl kiss because as its evolving weâ€™re all weâ€™re all working on the future and thatâ€™s not for today okay but itâ€™s not a good good use of our time yeah but even then so so if that if that were in prospect or if I were truly believing that weâ€™re in prospect Iâ€™d be Iâ€™d be all in because we could delegate some of the some of the some of the notarization pieces of call it directly to that the other pieces of my article I was trying to trying to point out where actually I donâ€™t see that in prospect anytime soon</em></p>

<p><em>thereâ€™s I know seven six seven eight massive stages and upgrade to the Ethereum Network has to go to go through to get to that point but thereâ€™s no guarantee that the end state one will be one will be achieved will be reached and two that it actually will deliver what he says itâ€™s highly risky risky cutting-edge R&amp;D.</em></p>

  <p>so well so weâ€™re all in that richard great Corda, Fabric weâ€™re all and anybody that says that weâ€™re in production in anything that looks like what we used to think of as production is selling a bag of tricks right where none of us are in production the way we used to think of production. weâ€™re all yeah maybe the transactions are going on but they all have training wheels</p>
</blockquote>

<p>if I could sorry quickly interrupt some silly conscious on time so I had a Marco strat which is a CTO of b3i and on just to clarify so b3i I actually uses Corda but he asked an interesting question which I want to put to the bow so if you need to keep each have perhaps one minute to answer it which is considering their regions of both of your block chains and in your history and where theyâ€™re heading is it possible to assume that the differences between public and private blockchains may shrink if thatâ€™s the case is there room for one for more than one protocol or perhaps one that could sit well between the both of you</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>yeah I think thatâ€™s the point is that there is a there is a there that all of us should compose a protocol that is if I need a Corda flow for this thing I should do that if I need to pass parameters back and forth between that flow and something that isnâ€™t on Corda Iâ€™m gonna need a coordinating chain for that Richard and I just to close out the point about finality, yeah we should probably take this offline Iâ€™d love to talk to with you at length about the from my point of view eventual consistency has its use and itâ€™s not at the coalface of the application because very often I need fast finality there right but I can do fast finality in your flow on a corridor network or on any other network tender mints pretty one block finality right but I can also put a slip transmission in there between that fast finality and an eventual consistency machine that gives me global state assurance of non temporariness and a few or a lack of tamper and if if your argument is that youâ€™re worried about a bunch of miners again that there are upgrades to that Iâ€™d say anybody worried about the decentralization of Ethereum in terms of mining should look at whatâ€™s happening with yeah proof I think itâ€™s vitalik was right you have to start with proof of work and then you move to a more sophisticated proof of stake system the that were where itâ€™s itâ€™s a lot more nuanced than just proof of work or proof of stake and then you want to layer in permissioned nodes and permissioned why canâ€™t I havenâ€™t run a mining operation that is actually identifying itself why canâ€™t every company have a miner on the on the main net as well making sure that the hash power does not stay and fall into the hands of parties that are that we donâ€™t know about right so we have just that sort space we have that trust lessness part we have the finality but if instant finality part but we also have eventual consistently because you cannot scale instant finality systems for that kind of</p>

<p>*that kind of this doesnâ€™t quite answer motivation but I kind of kind of feel I wanted all the best of all but kind of like the worst of all worlds which is stuff starting with starting with something which we all agree doesnâ€™t provide finality but is extremely costly and as as a questionable governance moving to something in the form of proof of stake thatâ€™s not yet proven may work may not when you will see but then you said then why not then layer on miners who are identified it kind of feels like now adding complexity to complexity rather than rather than it feels that way so Iâ€™m copying rather than the saying what if If I transacting with you want to know that the transaction canâ€™t be reversed in the following nine twelve thirteen odd number whatever parties thatâ€™s who we will rely on as there is the independent arbiter of what happened in what happened I think given that we canâ€™t make any firm statements about the probabilistic systems why not go straight to that rather than layer it on is like Stage four of seven elsewhere but but Tamakiâ€™s points so do we think these things will converge that the bid I actually didnâ€™t I didnâ€™t quite agree with the Marcusâ€™s question he talks about he goes back to the original question of public and private blockchains Iâ€™m not actually sure thatâ€™s the distinction because you look a Corda network you got accorded on network you could I donâ€™t know itâ€™s effectively a public network it is openly governed all the all the information there on how to have to take part in its governance is there anyone who can prove their identity can join thereâ€™s no nothing stopping anyone be able to join this itâ€™s itâ€™s a itâ€™s a public network albeit one that meets the requirements we think the business needs density finality point-to-point and all the rest of it the key distinction for me is how does that governance work do whoâ€™s confirming transaction did who gets to set the network parameters if thereâ€™s a hard fork is there a cabal of developers forcing it or is it openly debated by the users if thatâ€™s what I think is important but do I think thereâ€™s room for more than one of course coder is not designed to solve every problem just as no other platform is a totally agree with John this is their horses because heâ€™s choose the right solution to your business problem but we should do it on the basis of him whatâ€™s my requirement and what are the properties or what actually gets delivered by any given platform today or is in his roadmap for tomorrow because need to be really clear on those things so gentleman we are out of time</p>

<h2 id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding Thoughts</h2>

<p>so if you could please perhaps give each a one or two minute concluding thoughts to this podcast that would be great Iâ€™ll be very grateful about it John if you wanna have a go ahead I give you the final where to go so first of all I believe thanks for thinking thanks for putting this together Johnâ€™s right he and I used to speak so much and weâ€™ve both been so busy but like following our own track we had a good chance to catch up Susie almost felt like they want to our old oral chat</p>

<p><em>concluding thoughts really just reiterate what I just said I outlined at the start of this this podcast what problem we think weâ€™re trying to solve with blockchain in general with Corda in particular and if your listeners if youâ€™ve got if you have if youâ€™re in a situation where you are trying to do business with your counterparts competitors peers customers and you and you want to reduce the amount of error you want to reduce some of the situations where you disagree about things and importantly youâ€™re doing it you want to do it just to unlock new opportunity to be able to move faster move quicker and then seize new opportunities then blockchain in general and I would argue Corda in particular is what you should be looking at that is the thatâ€™s why this this industry exists I wonâ€™t rehearse the reasons why we went with the design we did but I just also just pick up on something that John said as well itâ€™s the truly open platforms that are are going to succeed so interview listening to this wondering which one to go with Iâ€™d love it if you chose Corda but whatever you do for for your own sanity and that of your your employees your employers and your customers choose an open source want whether itâ€™s Fabrics or one of the open source etherion variants or Corda because there are some there are some close source Ethereum enterprise variant so you have to be wary of but choose an open source one because of the network effects are so strong but net-net i thought this is a really really helpful discussion but do pay a lot of attention to finality it does matter yeah</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>right on so i first of all this is such a great richer we really should talk first of all I just I love you and always have so we the it what I used to say this when I was over at IBM that yeah I think very highly of Joe Lubin and Jerry Cuomo and Richard really as as three great coaches in a threeway soccer banter or multi of sight a soccer match where the coaches understand good sportsmanship and the team is more or less like each other right so I we can we can we can argue and even even yeah I hope my article was it was so much fun because I wanted to show you respect Richard but I also wanted to poke some fun and sheâ€™s like today you could do because I was if I took my gloves off in my face and you always came back it was gentle it was it was funny it was great well I was channeling you because you taught me gentleness in a lot of ways because I can be more gruff sometimes and I want to be more like theyâ€™re okay you really modeled that but so look the problem I see is Iâ€™m not Iâ€™m not here to advocate for corridor or Fabric or even Ethereum Iâ€™m saying that we are about to get weâ€™re gonna approach a hard freeze a blockchain Ice Age winter if we keep on running around in our private or public camps and by weight the</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>one thing I will quibble with you or Richard on is that a private blockchain or distributed ledger technology implementation that is that is accessible publicly is not but you might as well say that a SAS system is a public network so public means something different than that I thought is it useful sure SAS is useful is it the databases are useful so this is useful stuff and if calling a blockchain is how you get clients to to buy this stuff great thatâ€™s fine but I think that the stateful Internet which is what Iâ€™m advocating for and not that Iâ€™m trying to make that those two words into some kind of meme in fact I chose them because they are on and descriptive and probably donâ€™t turn into a hashtag right but a stateful Internet is one where we need to be able to seamlessly find parties connect them privately and then be able to pass information into and out of the functions that live on them without running into double spend race conditions non determinism and other nasty problems that happen with distributed systems and thatâ€™s why we need both kurta and things like whatâ€™s going coming out of Cornellâ€™s gun sears lab things like credi b and drivet itâ€™s why we need public networks like Ethereum and we need those to evolve all of this stuff needs to evolve and if we donâ€™t evolve together from here weâ€™re gonna find ourselves in an ice age because the things you can do purely on public main net black chains are very limited and the things that you can do sensibly on purely private blockchains donâ€™t really stand the up to the argument that they are you there delivering unique value you couldnâ€™t have done it some other way so but together</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>private and public together is powerful and is the Internet of the future and I think Iâ€™ll predict that when CEOs start just like back in the day remember Richard that you and I there was a guy at IBM that was managed out of the business for saying blockchain too soon and then for most later we could all say blockchain yeah because because the world had changed right it can happen pretty quick I think that right now saying public main net or public network watching scares a lot of CEOs but I predict that as soon as we show how you can have very very private things happening on these side chains and It was an unfortunate term side-chain I would call Corvo I would even call Bitcoin a side chain but I say that in respect it that side chains are where the action it is when those things can operate in conjunction with a public main net and where the where we have that join between a fast finality system on the side and a eventual consistency of machine gun system coordinating them I think then CEOs are going to wake up and say I not only am okay with public blockchain I demand it in the system just not all of it itâ€™s like chili powder it should be itâ€™s not the stake itâ€™s the itâ€™s not the meals itâ€™s the chili powder itâ€™s a small piece of of how we make all this stuff work if the poison is in the dough</p>
</blockquote>

<p>gentlemen Iâ€™m afraid weâ€™re out of time but Iâ€™ve absolutely loved this podcast I mean we touch on some incredible points which as you mentioned John you guys are gonna have to take off line and and come talk and debate about it but some of the points that came up weâ€™re weâ€™re not nearly near not production-grade thereâ€™s conversations about building this one protocol there is still some issues regarding finality nan some differences in your opinions but I very much the idea the like of the public and the private becoming the foundation on this future of the Internet so Iâ€™d like to thank you both very much for this wonderful debate and this wraps up this in intro blocks podcast weâ€™ve hope youâ€™ve enjoyed this episode and I hope to have you both back in the show maybe even at a conference perhaps we can organize it so I thank you very much both of you for attending this podcast like so much great speaking with you John pleasure as always and thanks for elite it was great you</p>
