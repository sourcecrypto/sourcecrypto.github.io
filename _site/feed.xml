I decided that I should try and organize all the types of information surrounding Bitcoin, Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, and began doing so in the channels of a discord server, SourceCrypto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, I’ve created a number of servers, realizing that it was easier to simply split off, and create a new one, once I wanted to get serious about another large subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between a dozen discord servers, and a handful of twitter accounts, I’ve been seriously retweeting, sharing to focused channels, organizing, archiving and otherwise keeping track of valuable information that would otherwise slip away… into the abyss of the intellect… along with all the other interesting things I’ve read, but didn’t keep references for, over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-collaborative-workflow&quot;&gt;A Collaborative Workflow?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year later, the idea that I could organize the varieties of information surrounding Bitcoin still seems foolish. Perhaps not so much as it did when I began. I never assumed that I could really accomplish my objective, however, I felt it was important to act and believe as though it were possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve only gotten serious about tech in the past few years, and have had quite a steep learning curve to catch up. To begin, I had a little experience maintaining Discord servers, and appreciate it’s UX, so it made sense for me to start there, rather than starting by seeking the ideal solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s always been my intent for these resources to be collaborative, and they have been open for such from the beginning. I have appreciated a number of contributors over that time, but the work has primarily been my own. I will admit that I’ve not been very social, or acted as an effective community organizer. Regardless, I’m pretty sure Discord isn’t the ideal venue for this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;foss-ideals-vs-pragmatism&quot;&gt;FOSS Ideals vs Pragmatism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, I’ve gone deeper and deeper into the world of Bitcoin, FOSS, Indieweb, Decentralized Identity, standards organizations, working groups and mailing lists. I’ve studied histories surrounding AI, Decentralized Web, Cyberpunks, Cypherpunks, MIT hackers, Sovereign Identity, Cryptography, and other histories of computing and the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During that time, the irony of using discord and twitter while preparing a foundation for a collaborative curation platform. Discord was a matter of convenience, Twitter was an essential component of my education. Despite it’s shortcomings, there is a lot of value to be gained from studying various fields through the lense of Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;moving-forward&quot;&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s time to move forward. I’d like to say I’m moving to 100% sovereign solutions, However, I’m not quite there yet. I have no definite answers, except that I’ll be restructuring this information into markdown and then structured data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m just getting to know google sheets, and decided I should get to know the GSuite a litte better before dismissing it altogether (my inclinatino). However, spreadsheets are extensible, and an ideal stepping stone, between what’s in the archives, and a variety of applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also begun to experiment with Notion as a power tool. It allows me to import the individual html files of the archives, transform them into a single page, and then export them to markdown, from which it’s managable to transform into a simple page of links organized by category, and from there to spreadsheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mattermost and keybase are both strong contenders for group chat platforms, I see them both doing well over the coming years. As far as social media, I think I’m better off looking to forum platforms and mailing lists… that’s a lot closer to the sources of information I tend to be looking for, and my target demographics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;subscribe-for-updates&quot;&gt;Subscribe for Updates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason for this post is to provide an update, since I’m taking a break from social media, particularly Discord and Twitter.. not sure how long of a break that will be, or how deep. However, I’ve deleted the discord servers, since I’ll never develop a new workflow, if I’m continually adding to the old ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I’m backing off from my day to day curation, so I can organize what I’ve got, learn some new apps, and take it to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like e-mail updates, since I won’t be on social media, you can sign up here. Eventually, I might experiment with a monthly newsletter or occasional promotional offers. However, that would be a distinct and separate opt-in list. This list is only for major site updates, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Getting the archives re-structured, and published in a naviable form.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finding a chat application suitable for collaborative curation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Launch of a shared spreadsheet application of SourceCrypto&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this list is growing to include a small collection of people I’ve worked with in the past year, perhaps an occasional survey to get your feedback would be in order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I have a hard time appreciating mailing lists that are sending updates all the time… pushing out content with hopes of generating leads. So yeah, I’m not into that, and this list doesn’t even have an auto-reply saying thanks for subscribing, yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the rare occasion I do send out an e-mail, you’ll always have the option to unsubscribe, and I’ll make sure each message is worth your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--danger&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only Email Required&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We’re pleased to be joined by the legendary cryptographer and computer scientist, David Chaum. From his early beginnings at Berkley, David pioneered many of the cryptographic techniques used in secure systems and cryptocurrencies today. Blind signatures, which are used in zero-knowledge proofs, and mix networks, used in Tor heavily rely on his work. At the dawn of the Internet, David founded DigiCash, what many believe to be a direct ancestor of Bitcoin. Today, David continues to pursue his mission to bring data privacy to all as his most recent project, Elixxir, aims to create a truly private messaging and payment app with a mass-market appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;transcript&quot;&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sebastien:&lt;/strong&gt;        We’re here with David Chaum. David Chaum needs no introduction in this space because he really he’s pioneered and set the stones that are the foundation for a lot of the things that we are building in the blockchain space. And I mean, personally for me, it’s a real pleasure and a real honor to have you on just because I’m so concerned by my own privacy. And a lot of these concepts are concepts that date back to when you were initially working on them and researching them and writing the papers that put all of this stuff in motion. So thank you for joining us today. It’s a real pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Chaum:&lt;/strong&gt;        Oh, thank you, Sebastian. It’s great to be here. Really appreciate it. Thanks for the kind words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;berkeley-and-the-birth-of-digital-cryptography&quot;&gt;Berkeley and the Birth of Digital Cryptography&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sebastien:&lt;/strong&gt;        Let’s start with the beginning. Tell us about your background, your time at Berkeley studying computer systems there and yeah, what was it back then to be working on these technologies?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Chaum:&lt;/strong&gt;        Well, you’re taking me, taking me back, but, this was Berkeley. It was a very exciting progressive place and my office mates and colleagues, there were people that, created a lot of famous stuff in the computer science field. I was working in that kind of department, and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://engineering.berkeley.edu/about/berkeley-engineering150/bill-joy-co-founder-sun-microsystems&quot;&gt;Bill Joy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Schmidt&quot;&gt;Eric Schmidt&lt;/a&gt; and all these people were, people I talk to all the time there and everything. &lt;a href=&quot;https://engineering.berkeley.edu/about/berkeley-engineering150/david-patterson-winning-risc&quot;&gt;Dave Patterson with the Risc Architecture&lt;/a&gt; and a lot of, key things were happening then as well as in cryptography. Those were really exciting times for all the real basic, research. And, so we had all kinds of people coming through, constantly visiting, talking about there are research and in cryptography and so forth. So it was,  but there was also a kind of,  backdrop of most of the graduate students or being recruited to work for the kind of military industrial complex. But there were a lot of posters up saying, don’t do this. So there were a lot of ethical issues in the air. I mean, this was Berkeley, 77 to ‘80-‘82. It was a, quite a mix of interesting things going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sebastien:&lt;/strong&gt;        So there were, there were some people that were going to work for kind of the government or it may be in industry. And then there are others that were kind of opposed to that. What were they doing? Were most mostly are working on research or did they have their own ideas about what they wanted to build? I guess you, you fell in that second credit category?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Chaum:&lt;/strong&gt;        Yes. Well, I believe that my work was, as far as I know, probably unique in taking advantage of the opportunity to do unconstrained research in order to find a way to use the technology to really advance dramatically the, the causes of public interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;computer-systems-established-maintained-trusted-mutual-suspicious-groups&quot;&gt;Computer Systems established, maintained, trusted, mutual suspicious groups&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friederike:&lt;/strong&gt;        So you got a PhD from Berkeley with a thesis entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chaum.com/publications/research_chaum_2.pdf&quot;&gt;computer systems established, maintained and trusted by mutual suspicious groups&lt;/a&gt;, which to anyone who’s familiar with the cryptocurrency sounds very modern, and if you actually look into this, the thesis puts forward, a system that has a lot of the hallmarks of Bitcoin. So basically you have the cryptographic a signatures, you have the peer to peer system, you don’t have the proof of work, but everything else kind of is now already. So what actually made you interested in these specific systems?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Chaum:&lt;/strong&gt;        This is the most fundamental problem in security of information technology generally, right? How can you make a computation that can be trusted by a group of people who don’t trust each other and bore specifically each say participants should have a privacy protected channel with the computation. The, it’s based on a published, an end mutually agreed algorithm that the computation is supposed to perform, but all of the state and data in the computation is hidden from everyone. But when the computation speaks publicly or over the secure channels to the individual participants, everyone can be certain that what it is saying is correct and this is a problem that I recognized early on as being kind of the fundamental issue. You could think of it as the sort of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis&quot;&gt;Church Turing theorem&lt;/a&gt;, or conjecture, for information security, because if you can solve that problem, then you I believe can solve any information security problem with that mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that’s an unproven conjecture, but it’s just like, saying that the touring machine can do any computation. You can’t really prove that, but it’s a conjecture that seems to have held up. So that’s why I was interested in it and I proposed a way to solve it in my dissertation. Now it’s a little bit ironic, I guess that my concerned about digital sovereignty in all made me not sign the copyright of my dissertation over to something called dissertation abstracts. That would… most of these, they’d be online and people could find them over. You could, you could order copies. So I kept the copyright and everything for mine. So it just basically lived in the library in a paper form. There were three copies in three different, parts of the, Berkeley, library system, but there was never digitized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so it pretty much escaped notice. Although you know how library books in the old days when there were physical books that you go to the library, then they would so put a little stamp in a with a date and all the, on a little sticker that was kind of on the inside cover of the book or something. So you can go back and look at these copies and see that there were instances of when they were checked out and because of the length of time that people had them, you can make inferences about the type of library status they had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;library-metadata-and-inventing-blockchain&quot;&gt;Library Metadata and Inventing Blockchain.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sebastien:&lt;/strong&gt;        Library metadata is a very dangerous, yeah cause he could go, you could go back now and you actually look at the library records and find out exactly who read those papers and basically just figure out exactly who the finite number of people who read that paper pretty much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Chaum:&lt;/strong&gt;        Right. But so at least from these little stamps, you can see that was checked out occasionally, but sometimes people kept it for a whole year and there are only certain people that are allowed to check out books for a whole year. So that’s it. There was, this was a down pretty much, but any event, yeah, so actually there was a recent paper that is mentioned on my Wikipedia page, Wikipedia page about me, I guess one should say that was by a professor, Alan Sherman and others that goes through.. And I think it provides the best kind of &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.06130.pdf&quot;&gt;taxonomy explanation of all the different variants that we’ve seen in the blockchain space&lt;/a&gt;. And it sort of organizes those and it highlights my contribution and basically, as you said, print it. It’s pretty much, the only thing that I didn’t anticipate in that work was the proof of work. But there are a lot of other types of consensus mechanisms as and there’s a point I’d like to make about that, which is I think worth trying to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is that back in those days, let’s say eight, 1980, the idea of burning up tons of computing time in order to, as for consensus, a algorithm was beyond reasonable. And it wasn’t until I believe 12 years later or so, about 94 that the idea of burning up time to have a winner’s who could, be the next block producer and so on… or the whole idea of using a proof of work for anything was proposed by one of my coauthors, Moni Naor, and I remember very clearly sitting in the auditorium there while, I believe Cynthia Dwork the other coauthor presented the paper. And I remember actually where I was sitting and just thinking about this as they proposed it in the context of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~naor/PAPERS/pvp.pdf&quot;&gt;a way to defeat or impede spam email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sebastien:&lt;/strong&gt; 
Was that a precursor to Hash Cash?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaum:&lt;/strong&gt; 
You could say that, but what I’m trying to point out is that the technique was already pretty well known. It’s just that you had to kind of wait until there was enough computing power and bandwidth and everything out there that any of this kind of stuff would make sense to say that someone in 82 didn’t fully invent blockchain. Just cause that that one type of consensus algorithm wasn’t included. I don’t think that’s reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friederike:&lt;/strong&gt;        Oh no, no. And it was very much not meant criticism in that sense. I was marveling at your foresight that…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Chaum:&lt;/strong&gt;        yeah, I mean I should maybe say it that way. I think maybe differently put differently. What’s really interesting to observe is that there, there has been a kind of inflection point that occurred in the last decade or so where we had enough computing power. It was cheap enough. And the connectivity, everything was there that we could have these unpermitted fund chains and use proof of work, say to control a consensus and that just wasn’t technically feasible prior to that. And so in my mind, a whole new idea it was that we really had to wait. There was enough computing power out there and everything to do this and that’s the thing that made the world different, In my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;relationship-with-cypherpunks&quot;&gt;Relationship with Cypherpunks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sebastien:&lt;/strong&gt;        I want to come back maybe to some, some earlier times when you were at Berkeley and you were working on these things and people were getting arrested for printing the RSA algorithm and trying to get it across the border. And that’s where you were, you were, you gravitating around those people, did you know &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourcecrypto.pub/posts/agoric/mark-miller-agoric-epicenter/&quot;&gt;Mark Miller&lt;/a&gt;, what he was up to and all the other cyber cypherpunks?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Chaum:&lt;/strong&gt;        yes, of course. And in some sense I think the way that it’s told is that I was the inspiration behind the whole cypherpunk thing, however, I wasn’t really 100% on board with let’s say, the tactics that were kind of enlivening the movement. Right. And so, I wasn’t a big fan of automatic weapons and explosives and all this other stuff. I was more like, maybe we could just get the powers… trick the powers that be into using stuff that would protect our privacy and we’d be a lot better off because going to war against them didn’t make a lot of sense to me. It is a real lot of fun to be in a movement thinking that you could actually do stuff that. But, I didn’t think that was, that realistic. It didn’t prove to be that realistic. So I was really trying to affect the change and not just have fun doing so. So that’s different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;on-permissionless-systems-guarding-against-government-circumvention&quot;&gt;On Permissionless Systems Guarding Against Government Circumvention&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sebastien:&lt;/strong&gt;        Do you have similar views about the way you know people in the blockchain space now? And so you were recently at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig-fGao8lMg&quot;&gt;Web3 summit&lt;/a&gt;, all these young people now that are building these privacy technologies and trying to, I guess in some way, fight the system. Do you feel similarly about their approach to trying to build permissionless technologies that can’t be circumvented by governments, et cetera?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Chaum:&lt;/strong&gt;        Especially that’s, that’s a pretty deep question. And I’d like to say that, I’ve been trying to make the world a better place for my whole career. And very often I see a number of different avenues and approaches that, my peers and colleagues, take. And this is a multi-factor evaluation that you have to make about each one. I mean it, so is it an approach? Okay, yes, it’s in a positive direction, but is it an approach that can go the full distance that’s needed? What are the obstacles to that? Are those fundamental or are those things that will just improve over time and over what time frame you expect that they will improve? So you have to kind of try to pick your best bet and sort of ride that out. If you’re really serious about effecting change, if you’re just trying to be happy with that, you’re doing something that isn’t a bad thing or that’s in a good direction, that’s a different consideration. I’ve put some real thought into finding ways to actually do things that could really make a substantial difference and, that makes me appreciate all the people that are working. But it doesn’t mean that I wouldn’t try to redirect their efforts if I thought that could work. Does that make sense?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sebastien:&lt;/strong&gt;        Yeah, that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Chaum:&lt;/strong&gt;        It’s a pity to have to say. So I would say, but I’m pretty serious about all this and I, I tend to try to figure out what I think the best thing to do is. And the primary consideration is not about me personally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fundamental-work&quot;&gt;Fundamental Work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friederike:&lt;/strong&gt;        I get that. So the impact that you’ve made on cryptography is really hard to overstate. So you just, just for the benefit of our listeners, so you invented &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4757-0602-4_18&quot;&gt;blind signatures&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/0-387-34805-0_20&quot;&gt;undeniable signatures&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://chaum.com/publications/Group_Signatures.pdf&quot;&gt;group signatures&lt;/a&gt;, you invented &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freehaven.net/anonbib/cache/chaum-mix.pdf&quot;&gt;mixers&lt;/a&gt;, you introduced the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=19517&quot;&gt;predecessor to secret sharing&lt;/a&gt;, and you jumpstarted the field of zero knowledge proofs and probably many other things that I have neglected. Tying into what you said, just an idea, which one of these do you think is going to become the most important to society and why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Chaum:&lt;/strong&gt;        Well, let me answer an easier question first while I’m thinking about that, the most fundamental work is you didn’t mention, which is the multi-party computation, there’s a series of papers. So you could say that zero knowledge, which I was on par with… there was sort of two competing groups, the MIT group and my group. We kinda had all three results at more or less the same time. And actually, we ended up winning the best paper awards, and getting papers invited to journals. But you could prove things to the world that’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-46877-3_41.pdf&quot;&gt;zero knowledge&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://crypto.cs.mcgill.ca/~crepeau/PDF/BCC88-jcss.pdf&quot;&gt;minimum disclosure&lt;/a&gt; were the two models that I proposed where the MIT only had the &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.csail.mit.edu/silvio/Selected%20Scientific%20Papers/Zero%20Knowledge/Noninteractive_Zero-Knowkedge.pdf&quot;&gt;zero knowledge model&lt;/a&gt;. Then the computationally based &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-48184-2_7&quot;&gt;multi-party computation&lt;/a&gt; work, and then there’s the &lt;a href=&quot;http://crypto.cs.mcgill.ca/~crepeau/PDF/ASPUBLISHED/CCD88A.pdf&quot;&gt;honest majority work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So those are two different full, multi-party computation models. And then the final thing that tied it all together as is my work they didn’t do, which is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/0-387-34805-0_52&quot;&gt;spymasters double agent problem&lt;/a&gt; work. You could see it on my website, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chaum.com&quot;&gt;chaum.com&lt;/a&gt;. So this has the best of both worlds. If you have unlimited computing power, then you still have to have a majority participants to defeat the security system. So this is the robust fundamental stuff. I’m really hoping that the two things that I’m focused on now can dramatically change the world, and I think it’s become very clear that this stuff is really needed. And one is, you can see on the Elixxir home &lt;a href=&quot;https://elixxir.io&quot;&gt;landing page&lt;/a&gt; the video, in a little more in detail, but basically the &lt;em&gt;messaging integrated with payments&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;dApps&lt;/em&gt; or mini-apps, in the same namespace, has proven to be the killer app for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see that by we chat and what Facebook’s tried to do and the other major platforms in, in smaller markets. So this is an indisputable fact that, it makes perfect sense. That’s what people want. So if we can provide that, which is what my current companies dedicated to in an unpermissioned manner that shreds the metadata in real-time, and has a very secure payment system, that is comparable to the non-secured, to the other systems, in terms of performance, user interface and so forth. And where we have an easy to build on dApp platform, then I think that is one of the two key things that’s needed because, if you don’t have a protected space where people can communicate with certainty that they’re not being observed, among their friends and family, to obtain information about what’s going on in the world, and support the collection and distillation of information financially, if you don’t have those protected spheres, you cannot have meaningful democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s becoming, unfortunately quite abundantly clear these days. We could come back to that. But, the other thing, which I think is really fundamental and I’m very excited about, however, it’s taken a little bit of a backseat right now because so much going on with the messaging and the payments, the debeda and stuff that we’re working on. But the new type of, of voting that I’ve proposed and that we’ve run a binding elections with, which is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chaum.com/publications/Random-Sample%20Elections.pdf&quot;&gt;sample voting&lt;/a&gt; is something that looks extremely promising to me because it allows direct democracy to scale with both the size and the complexity of society. And it’s quite applicable for governance of our blockchain. And I think that will really demonstrate it will really shine there. But if you ask me what I think so might be the most important contributions, I think those, those two and, and they’re interrelated right now&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;metadatas-relationship-with-privacy&quot;&gt;Metadata’s Relationship with Privacy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sebastien:&lt;/strong&gt;        I’d like to ask you about something you mentioned a few times already and that’s about metadata. Why do you feel that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata&quot;&gt;metadata&lt;/a&gt; is so critical to the privacy and sovereignty and vision of individuals and because a lot of times people talk about their privacy and I think they [only] consider the message. “I don’t want people to be able to read my message,” but I don’t think people really consider the importance of metadata. How would you effectively communicate that to someone that beyond the message that all the extra inferences that we can make them up, that metadata are as equally weaponizable, I guess,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Chaum:&lt;/strong&gt;        well, what I’d like to say is that back in the 80s and so forth, privacy was a kind of a free standing issue. And I think in the last year or so, the public has come to recognize the significance of metadata as far as it’s enabling the manipulation of public opinion and allowing for the sort of taking control of nation States in the democratic portions of the world. And this is a fundamental and sort of irreversible phenomenon. Whereas if you look at the non-democratic parts of the world, you see that the same manipulation of media… and so on, is underway and diffusing any real hope of kind of a rise of public sentiment. Just look at the way China has manipulated mainland opinion related to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/13/world/asia/hong-kong-protests-china.html&quot;&gt;recent events in Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;. I was just reading about it. This is quite, quite stunning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then that sort of the carrot side and then the stick side is, there are people that are disappeared and their, their access to their, their bank accounts aren’t disconnected and so forth based on the surveillance of WeChat and so forth. So it’s this type of ferreting out who can be manipulated around which issues and manipulating the apparent will of the public online is something that’s so powerful for almost all of the populations on the planet. It’s I sad, I think it’s a profound and sort of irreversible, dangerous specially given the progress in artificial intelligence and sort of the immense amount of data that’s already been kind of vacuumed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is fascinating and I, we will definitely get back to this in a little bit just before we do and it’s completely fine if you don’t want to, but what do you mind disclosing how you protect your privacy online at the moment? Just because most of us, I mean most of us use Google and almost all of us at some point or other used to use Facebook and I mean Facebook is not such a thing anymore. But I mean I know very few people who can actually live without Google and other big tech giants and it’s very difficult to protect yourself. Right? And your privacy and your data&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all. I have not been a user of social media and there were a few things that come out, but it’s not really for me actually. But in any event, now that the Elixxir platform is starting to become available, I really have no excuse not to use something that actually does protect privacy and shred the metadata and so forth. I’m gonna start to become a user guide. That’s about as much as I’d like to say about my own personal activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;privacy-practices-and-social-media&quot;&gt;Privacy Practices and Social Media&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sebastien:&lt;/strong&gt;        Okay. So, so you, I mean, you don’t use Facebook or any social media and things that, I presume. Do you use services Google,  Gmail of this sort of thing? Or do you have some sort of, personal ops sec process that, you’ve developed to protect your privacy but still have the ability to communicate effectively with people?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Chaum:&lt;/strong&gt;        I said, I’m not a user of social media, but I will start using Elixxir and I try to make the best use of my personal energy to make the most effective change globally. And sometimes that means making compromises in terms of my own personal protection, where I better put the energy into, try to come up with things that really can address the key issues and trying to find a way to get them out that seems attractive too to the widest possible audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;expressing-the-need-for-privacy&quot;&gt;Expressing the Need for Privacy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sebastien:&lt;/strong&gt;        I get, I mean, we all have to make compromises at some point. I mean, so personally in the last year or so, I’ve pretty much stop using any Google services for anything personal. I have my own mail server in my house, I’ve set all that up. I use signal with my family, but it takes a lot of time, right? And I’ve infested maybe hundreds of hours and getting all this &lt;a href=&quot;https://epicenter.tv/episode/272/&quot;&gt;opsec&lt;/a&gt; set up and everything, and having products that appeal to the masses where you don’t need to know how to use Linux for example, or any, any more complex than just installing an app is highly desirable. So in that context, something like Elixxir, which we’ll get to in a few minutes I think fulfills that need, where it’s a simple app that you install on your phone, WhatsApp or anything that and people can use it just as they’re used to using any, any sort of messaging app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that I found challenging a was getting friends and family to use the systems that I was using and that I thought would protect my privacy. So for example, I got my family and most of my friends that I talked to regularly with do you use signal and signal is an encrypted and open source version of WhatsApp where there’s still metadata, presumably, but not under the Facebook umbrella I guess. And so the challenge was getting people to use that. With something like Elixxir, what are some of the immediate steps that you’ve taken? How have you effectively communicated that with, your friends and colleagues for them to start using those systems? where you’re not using Facebook or WhatsApp or any of these other things that normal people use?  I would say people that are not so concerned about the privacy like we are?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Chaum:&lt;/strong&gt;        well the history of social media, even though at any moment in time it looks the most dominant systems are never going to be displaced, the history proves that every few years there is the mass migration to the next best thing. And this has happened, more than a half dozen times and I believe that now the public has become quite disenchanted with the tech powers that be, they feel betrayed by the fact that they, their data has been misused without their permission of course and with such devastating consequences for faith in democracy, and so on. And so there is a huge opportunity at this moment, which is to create an unpermissioned social media system, which is a messaging which is all the new users basically interested in messaging, integrated with payments we chat and the rest is, I’ve said which supports dApps in the same namespace, that shreds metadata in real time and that is free to users, the consumers, so ordinary people and that has the capacity to scale to address a full out global use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So such a technology which we are &lt;a href=&quot;https://elixxir.io/xx-network&quot;&gt;building and starting to roll out&lt;/a&gt; has the ability to destroy what amounts to essentially $1 trillion worth of market cap of these companies that have been exploiting the public secretly and creating this huge danger to society and to sort of give away for free to the public what it is they really want, which is these abilities to transact without being spied on. And there’s interestingly no way that these major players can compete with such a thing because they are not un-permissioned. They are companies. And so they cannot shred the data apparently because governments seem to want to be able to force them to give it to them so and their business model’s based on it. So we have this ability to dramatically change the whole landscape by creating an un-permissioned chain which offers these kinds of capabilities to the public for free. So I think that with the thought leaders and people yourselves and, and your listeners on this podcast and so forth, this can provide the sort of initial critical mass that will then because of the network effect lead to a mass migration and that can be a tremendously helpful thing for the future of the free world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-great-hack&quot;&gt;The Great Hack&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friederike:&lt;/strong&gt;        Yeah. And these things, after they’ve crossed a certain point, they permeate society way faster than one would, would have ever thought. Right. I mean basically you get these major consensus narrative shifts.  well beforehand everyone had one opinion and then everyone just kind of shifts more or less at the same time. And you get you get this mass migration to a new thing and I think you may be completely right in that. We may be seeing that soon because people are being sensitized about what Facebook and the Facebook’s of the world are doing. That recently a movie on Netflix came out, a documentary called &lt;a href=&quot;www.thegreathack.com&quot;&gt;the great hack&lt;/a&gt;. Have you seen it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Chaum:&lt;/strong&gt;       Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friederike:&lt;/strong&gt;        Yes. So basically if you go listeners haven’t seen it yet.  it’s totally worth of watch. It’s about Facebook and how Cambridge Analytica used metadata to influence voting behavior. It’s very scary. So it’s very dystopian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Chaum:&lt;/strong&gt;        and I just like to point out that if you were to just look into it a bit, you’d see that Cambridge Analytica by its own admission has been active in most of the large &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica#Elections&quot;&gt;democracies around the globe&lt;/a&gt; and there are dozens of other companies which seem to be terribly pursuing similar business and similar approach. So it’s not something that’s going to go away. It’s only quite surprising to me that it even became, known to the general public. It’s quite a sea change that we’re witnessing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;origins-of-digicash&quot;&gt;Origins of Digicash&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friederike:&lt;/strong&gt;        Yeah. I want to go into your solution for this problem a little bit later on in the show. But let’s talk about your first company. Your first company was DigiCash. Can you tell us when you got the idea for digicash and, how it actually worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Chaum:&lt;/strong&gt;        Sure. Well, in 1982 I published a little paper on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chaum.com/publications/Chaum-blind-signatures.PDF&quot;&gt;blind signature based payments&lt;/a&gt;. Then in the mid nineties I was running a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iacr.org&quot;&gt;research group&lt;/a&gt;, one of the top research groups in the world on cryptography and… it was in Amsterdam in the Netherlands, and the Dutch government came to us and said, we want to do a road toll system here in the Netherlands, but we don’t want the government to be able to know where everyone is driving. And so we’re wondering is it possible to have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chaum.com/publications/ScientificAmerican-AEP.pdf&quot;&gt;smart-car based automatic road toll collection system&lt;/a&gt;, with the radio transponders just like we see around the world today, but where the identity of the vehicles is not disclosed, but the payments are, are made and the pricing varies during the day. And I said, well, that’s funny. You should ask, I actually invented something in 1982 that could do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they said, Oh, well, really? Well, I mean, would it be fast enough? at a hundred kilometers an hour, the radio connection only exists for about a meter of road travel. So that’s not a lot of time to complete a payment. And I said, Oh yeah, I think we could do it. And they said, Oh really? Well. I said, yeah, well say what if, if we can do it in two weeks, will you give us a contract to build it? We can prove to you that we could do it in two weeks. And they said, sure. So I got a bunch of students and we wired up this house, and it was a crash project. And in about 10 days actually built a little hardware gizmo that used to say, kind of micro controllers that a smart card of 60 to five. And, we demonstrated that we could make these blind signature payments in a special way, at that kind of speed. And so they gave us the contract and we had to build that. And so I hired the students and we started building it. And this was a done on the same campus as my research group, but it was in a separate facility and eventually as the web started to emerge, I moved over to actually run the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;digicash-usecases&quot;&gt;Digicash Usecases&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sebastien:&lt;/strong&gt;        So from there this was kind of the inception of DigiCash and so DigiCash was used to manage this toll payment system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Chaum:&lt;/strong&gt;        Well they never built the road toll systems actually, but that’s the most, wasn’t because our part didn’t work. We partnered with a company called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1992-08-25-9203170615-story.html&quot;&gt;Amtech&lt;/a&gt; and we demonstrated it and everything, but the government guy just got cold feet that it’s really interesting, but I think you can get a lot of insight and perspective from their big fear was that if they built this, that people would in mass ignore it and just not pay. And even though they would have photographs of all the cars and stuff, there’d be such a mass opposition to it that it would erode the power of government. It would be, it’d be extreme embarrassment to them. So that was I think why they decided not to do it in the end because… the Dutch don’t like to pay for anything, let’s put it that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;digicash-user-base&quot;&gt;Digicash User-Base&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sebastien:&lt;/strong&gt;        Yeah. How was DigiCash put to use them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Chaum:&lt;/strong&gt;        Well, in 1994 I gave one of two keynotes and the first keynote at the worldwide web conference. It was &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/19970808071850/http://www.cern.ch/WWW94/Welcome.html&quot;&gt;the first worldwide web conference in Geneva&lt;/a&gt;. And what I did of this in those days was, we use the web browser to make the slide presentations right. And this was projected by a huge projector. And I made the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chaum.com/ecash/articles/1994/05-27-94%20-%20World_s%20first%20electronic%20cash%20payment%20over%20computer%20networks.pdf&quot;&gt;first E cash payment&lt;/a&gt; from Geneva to Amsterdam, and launched this idea that number could be worth money, so-called digital bearer instrument. And launched the DigiCash company. And this was picked up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/1994/12/emoney/&quot;&gt;by all kinds of media&lt;/a&gt; around the world. Within a couple of days, there was a lot of interest in the idea that a number could be worth money, a digital bear instrument. And so we were very much in the spotlight and we kind of started with the first thing which was called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chaum.com/ecash/&quot;&gt;cyberbucks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is a digital currency as currently understood but different than a few ways. So one commonality is that it had a limited amount of the currency that was going to ever be issued. So that was an interesting thing, a good innovation. The another thing was that of course all the transactions conducted online, it differs technically from current blockchain which have, arguably, zero privacy, right? Whereas digicash use of the blind signature concept you mentioned earlier that has a really nice special kind of privacy with some metric called &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F3-540-45961-8_10.pdf&quot;&gt;one way privacy or payer anonymity&lt;/a&gt;, which is essentially that only the person who forms the digital coin, initially at random, should be the user can recognize it later. So it’s hidden by a blinding process when it’s received the validating signature by the issuer so that when they’re used, user receives it back, they can unblind it and spend it and everyone can see that it’s really signed and they just have the truck checked for the double spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that digital coin is unlinked bubble to the withdrawal process where it was originally signed. So what it amounts to is that as the payer, you can always irrefutably prove who received the money from you, but they cannot find out who you are. And that it turns out as the kind of an ideal kind of privacy because at the time of what’s called the bank for international settlements, you guys, the central banks that are bag proclaimed that criminal use of payments could be divided. The three types, extortion, black markets and bribery. And if you think about it, such a one way privacy it makes the money unsuitable for any criminal use. Because you know what kidnapper would accept payment by check or, or what politician would accept the bribe by, wire transfer or in a black market. It’s always sort of follow the money up the hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it was quite unique. And so what this means is that each coin has a phase one of a fixed set of denominations. On current blockchain, where that is in effect a digital check system where each transfer has a potentially unique amount, which links it horizontally from account to account from, well I need a wallet ID with, with DigiCash each 1 cent or 2 cent 4 cent eights that we use. A binary denomination scheme just is a little more efficient, but each, each such domination has its own type of signature and its own sort of freestanding digital bearer instrument that’s kind of a containerized, just retired version of money that prevents or reduces, the horizontal traceability from, from account to account to account. So that because of the standardization of and that sort of breaking the payments up in, into just paper money and coins today, metal coins. So another difference of the DigiCash, technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sebastien:&lt;/strong&gt;        So who are the users of the DigiCash? Were there sort of classes of people that you could kind of say we’re using this? Was it mostly for online purchases or were there are certain use cases that you were starting to kind of pick up on when, when, when it started getting traction?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Chaum:&lt;/strong&gt;        Well, so those initial payments were part of the Cyberbucks and you could call today in airdrop. So basically we said we’re only going to issue this amount and we will give it away for free. But our condition on that was that you have to create a shop, an online web based shop that accepts cyber bucks for something. And then we would give you a hundred cyber bucks and that’s how we rolled it out. And if you go to chaum.com you can see it’s sort of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chaum.com/ecash/&quot;&gt;e-cash museum&lt;/a&gt;. You can see all the press releases in somebody, you can actually see the icons of a lot of the shops that, were up issuing, selling things for ecash and that participate in the CyberBucks launch of ecash bots. Then we also subsequently licensed banks around the world to issue ecash in their national currency at the time, as well as for internal use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the […] securities, they use it internally, but we had issuers in most, most continents. We had Australian dollars, we had US dollars. In those days it was pre Euro, so this would be at the Deutschmark and then a number of other licensees in Scandinavia and so forth. So actually &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB831416067295410500&quot;&gt;Deutsche bank&lt;/a&gt; in those days was the biggest bank in, in Europe, indisputably. And they were like toughest customer. They had a data center that was an old bunker underground and they wanted every kind of industrial audit back up, role in every kind of protection and everything. And so we had to build all that stuff for them and they, they deployed it and there were shops that accepted payments, why he cash Deutschmarks and so they were very enthusiastic about it. And so they were moving forward and as we’re, so there’s a lot of interest in the, in this technology and the, in the product, a lot of perspectives. But the web has grown very, very rapidly in those days. And, I don’t know if you recall, but people were reluctant to make payments using their credit cards, but e-commerce was projected as to something that was, was going to happen. And so there was just a, it was very difficult to deploy. It was somewhat of a labor of love to install. And he cashed client in your computer in those days and keep it up to date and eh, and so forth. So it was a, the interesting times&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reserve-backed-ecash&quot;&gt;Reserve Backed ECash&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sebastien:&lt;/strong&gt;        I remember back in my mid teens in the late nineties, wanting to buy some, I wanted, I wanted to order an SSH server or something, and the only way to do it was to pay online. And of course, it didn’t have a credit card as a teenager. So I asked my mom if I could use hers and she’s like, I’m not putting my credit card number online. And you’re crazy. So what she ended up doing, she got an extra credit card with a $500 limit just so that I could buy stuff online. And, so having something like digi cash back then would have been very useful.  or something like, obviously Bitcoin or something that. also, but so, so DigiCash was backed by actual reserves, right? there was us dollars or Deutsche bank or something in a bank account representing these, individual coins. Correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Chaum:&lt;/strong&gt;        A handful of banks around the world which issued E cash. And what that technically meant was that if you had an account at their bank, then you could withdraw money from your account into E cash, just you could visit an ATM machine and withdrawn into paper money. So you could load up your ecash wallet from your bank account and then you could spend that money. But it was in the form of these binary denominated digital bearer instruments that all of our payments were privacy protected in that way, with blind-signatures then you, you could spend that at any of the shops that would except it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sebastien:&lt;/strong&gt;        it strikes me that this is kind of similar to, so some of the assets back stable coins that we see in the space now and in some way it put setting aside all the privacy issues, et cetera. But in some way it is a little bit similar to what Facebook has proposed in Libra in that cryptocurrency. Would you not say so?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Chaum:&lt;/strong&gt;        Well way I frame it is that we issued a free standing digital currency cyberbucks. And we had a way to get it except that a lot of merchants and we gave it away. So we were trying to create our own currency with a bounded cap. And in parallel with that we allowed others to issue their own versions of it and we help them do that. And those others all turned out to be banks or I think there were also the, Nora was a research organization and I think that the Sweden pulse license it so people would want to use it beyond other than bags. But we try to make it available to anyone who wanted to use it. But in those days we had to help them do it. And so we wanted this stuff to be come the digital currency, but there was such a rapid growth, that hesitation and then lurch forward of growth and was not anywhere near as convenient as credit cards &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/1999/sep/30/onlinesupplement&quot;&gt;once that became a viable option&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friederike:&lt;/strong&gt;        … imagine a private person, if I accept your eCash, what’s my route to redeeming it for Fiat? Can I do that with any bank or just my bank? Or how does it work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Chaum:&lt;/strong&gt;        Back in the, in the DigiCash days, there were banks that excepted E cash in different currencies and would, we’re willing to convert them exchanges. So there was a bank called Twain bank in the U S they issued you a Starz, but they would also accept other currencies I and convert. So the only way that you could get, let’s say into or out of fee art was through a bank account that was denominated in that fee of currency. And that was w was provided by a bank that was actually part of the eco system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friederike:&lt;/strong&gt;        And so basically the banks within the eco system, they didn’t set it amongst themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Chaum:&lt;/strong&gt;        I think it was a little simpler than that, but more or less, yeah, I mean they had just like, if you don’t understand how national banking works, I mean they had accounts at correspondent banks and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ecash-business-model&quot;&gt;ECash Business Model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friederike:&lt;/strong&gt;        Okay, I see. And what was the business model of e-cash?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Chaum:&lt;/strong&gt;        you mean the business model of the company, DigiCash?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friederike:&lt;/strong&gt;        Yeah, exactly. So basically, how was DigiCash meant to make money?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Chaum:&lt;/strong&gt;        Well, DigiCash did make money and I mean, we did the cyber box thing for free and we hope to really foster the creation of an alternative currency based on, pretty idealistic vision for that. But we also, licensed banks and organizations as I mentioned. And, and for that, they paid us for the right to do it and paid us to help them. And we had S I think a the sound and sustainable business model. But then as the web really started to take off, we saw, I decided that this technology was too important to not be given a chance to really rise with the tide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we took in a substantial investment and I think the strings attached to that in the end didn’t really have the same interest in making the world a better place. So that was the decision I made too because it was put very clearly internally, we could have just kept on keeping on in a modest way and that would have been much safer for us and that would’ve been fine. Like, you mentioned business model in your question, but I decided that we should really just go for, try to make the world a better place and try to rise with the tide. So we took in fair amount of money under terms that assume that those people who put the money in really had the same concern about changing the world as us. But in the end that in proved to be the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;high-level-overview-of-elixxir&quot;&gt;High Level overview of Elixxir&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sebastien:&lt;/strong&gt;        Let’s get back to this topic that has been falling us through this conversation, which is Elixxir, your current project. Can you give us a high level overview of what is the here and what’s the goal here? what, what are you trying to achieve with this new project?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Chaum:&lt;/strong&gt;        Elixxir aims to be a free to consumers messaging and payments platform that is second to none in terms of privacy because it’s unique in its ability to shred the metadata to provide the kind of transaction speeds that people are accustomed to and has the capability to scale to the bandwidth that’s needed for mass adoption. And that also allows for the integration of dApps and in that way positions itself as a a full alternative to the we chat or a Facebook with labor or some of these other offerings. And, and I believe a very attractive alternative. And with the network effects we can expect perhaps a very rapid transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-arms-race-between-surveillance-and-privacy-advocates&quot;&gt;An Arms Race Between Surveillance and Privacy Advocates?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friederike:&lt;/strong&gt;        That sounds super exciting. And, we, we are doing an episode, especially on Elixxir in the near future, so an entire hour dedicated to this topic. It seems to me that maybe we’re at some sort of turning point. I mean basically the, the past couple of years or the past couple of decades have been, an race between people who are interested in surveillance and surveilling people, nation States and other actors and, people who are developing ways to preserve your privacy. Would you agree with this? And, what do you think are the possible outcomes? W
hat are the possibilities that you anticipate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Chaum:&lt;/strong&gt;        Well, I wouldn’t characterize the past couple of decades as an arms race between governments and let’s say good intention developers, but rather, unfortunately, it’s a pity to have to say. So what I think that there’s been a lot of kind of honeypots set up that lured good intention people into using systems that were a little bit hard to use, but actually simply revealed them as people who were concerned about their privacy. And if you look at things the Arab spring, so-called or other kinds of movements, it’s always really surprising how easily all the leaders that are identified and eventually arrested in or whatever disappeared. And it’s recently was revealed that China also has, what Snowden told us, the US government has the full take, the ability to surveil the entire network (&lt;em&gt;Needs Citation&lt;/em&gt;). And what that means of course is that tor is simply a transparent to both of these major power groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And similarly a lot of other good intention things turned out that to really be adequate solutions. So, I think that we’re, we’re at a really great point because all that good work and intention and so on has resulted in a, a culture of and an understanding of a lot of these issues at a tactical level by developers and so on. A real interest to see this happen. So we’ve gone to a lot of momentum and now with the ability to do un-permissioned chains and with some of the technology breakthroughs that I’ve been working on to try to speed up some of this stuff and so forth. And we have a thousand X speed up in, in mixing with Elixxir, right, which is needed for chat with the parallel realization by the public in effect. This is the whole game. If you cannot have protected sphere, then you’ve lost control over governance. And that may be something that’s very difficult to recover. So I think it’s now we’re, we’re at a really exciting point in this, in this, in this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;optimism-for-the-future-and-creating-white-hat-malware&quot;&gt;Optimism for the Future, and creating ‘White-Hat Malware’&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sebastien:&lt;/strong&gt;        I’m glad you’re optimistic this because my, my views on this stuff has have become slightly tainted over the last couple of years and I’ve become more pessimistic about it. I feel that these platforms have gained so much power and they’ve gained power for a couple of reasons, but one of the reasons that they become powerful is because, well, obviously they connect people, right? people want that connection. But I think that they also exploit very primitive aspects of what makes us human. So I believe there’s quite a few studies out there that talk about kind of how Facebook and Instagram and the, the light culture affects,  neuro-receptors in our brains and how they accurately hit our, our pleasure receptors, etcetera. And it’s almost an exploit, right? It’s almost these platforms are exploiting our brains. some, some malware. I think for platforms that try to, do the right thing and not use people’s data to exploit their privacy and their voting habits or like, get them to buy stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All those people that are on the other side doing the right thing, I think that they may be also need to try to approach this with that same malware approach. But the white hat version of that, right? what’s the white hat version of the Facebook button that or the Instagram button that just gets you coming back all the time but, but doesn’t exploit you as a user. And I think that the space of good intention, people haven’t yet figured out what the white hat version of that is. And I really hope that  people you and the folks working on Elixxir and other products it, get to figure that out and get to create that, that massive network effect that topples Facebook and makes it the next my space. You know what I mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friederike:&lt;/strong&gt;        But in principle, there’s not a reason why you shouldn’t be able to build that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Chaum:&lt;/strong&gt;        Yes, that’s right. That’s what we, when I proved back in the late eighties what the multi-party computation results prove is that if there’s any way to create a white hat incentivization or reward scheme that doesn’t inherently exploit data, then cryptography can allow for it to be realized securely and transparently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;daos&quot;&gt;DAOs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friederike:&lt;/strong&gt;        Do you feel that DAOs have a place in this, in the governance of these protocols?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Chaum:&lt;/strong&gt;        Well, I think that yes, it’s, it’s essential that there is a kind of democratic structure that controls this infrastructure and that’s, as I mentioned earlier, was one of the two key ingredients. I think you need protected spheres and you need a kind of democracy that scales with complexity and size of the system. Those two ingredients together that can solve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friederike:&lt;/strong&gt;        I think those are nice last words. Maybe this is a good point to end this episode. It was a great pleasure to have you on. We talked about this before the episode. We’ll have you on again very soon. When you’re ready to talk about Alexia, your platform and blockchain that runs on it at practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Chaum:&lt;/strong&gt;        Great. Yeah. Well this was really a blast and interesting and I appreciate, your good question is interesting year and your thoughts and, and I look forward to continuing the conversation. Thank you very much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sebastien:&lt;/strong&gt;        Thanks so much David.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin has proven its dominance, and I’m increasingly compelled to focus &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; more on acquiring practical experience, aiming towards a sovereign work-flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are already a number of excellent infomative lists, resources pages, and other collections, I haven’t noticed any that focused specifically on &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began by sorting through the links I’ve collected over the past year, then scouring lopp.net, bitcoin.org, Bitcoin Only, LNRoute… “one link at a time”, sorting them in an iterative process, until clear categories began to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I got into the Awesome lists, I felt like I had surveyed a broad swath of the practical Bitcoin info-systems. Next, I dove face first into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/topics/bitcoin&quot;&gt;Bitcoin Topic&lt;/a&gt; on Github. As far as practical applcations of Bitcoin, it’s hard to find a more comprehensive source than that. I’m still not through the entire list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is an implementation of the Electrum server protocol which fulfills the specific need of using the Electrum wallet backed by a full node, but without the heavyweight server backend, for a single user. It allows the user to benefit from all of Bitcoin Core’s resource-saving features like pruning, blocksonly and disabled txindex. All of Electrum’s feature-richness like hardware wallet integration, multisignature wallets, offline signing, seed recovery phrases, coin control and so on can still be used, but connected only to the user’s own full node. Full node wallets are important in bitcoin because they are an big part of what makes the system be trustless. No longer do people have to trust a financial institution like a bank or paypal, they can run software on their own computers. If bitcoin is digital gold, then a full node wallet is your own personal goldsmith who checks for you that received payments are genuine. Full node wallets are also important for privacy. Using Electrum under default configuration requires it to send (hashes of) all your bitcoin addresses to some server. That server can then easily spy on your transactions. Full node wallets like Electrum Personal Server would download the entire blockchain and scan it for the user’s own addresses, and therefore don’t reveal to anyone else which bitcoin addresses they are interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Bitcoin Core initial synchronization will take time and download a lot of data. You should make sure that you have enough bandwidth and storage for the full block chain size (over 200GB). If you have a good Internet connection, you can help strengthen the network by keeping your PC running with Bitcoin Core and port 8333 open. Read the full node guide for details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In this episode, we talk about what it is like to set up a full node. Speaking with the Parity community support lead, Thibaut Sardan, we also explore the features of the Parity Ethereum client, the light client, and help answer some frequently asked questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There’s a common misconception that all full nodes store the entire blockchain. The reality is a bit more complex: (1) A new node downloads the entire chain only to trustlessly compute the current UTXO set: what coins exist and who owns them (also called the chainstate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, if you’re not processing a multitude of transactions, perhaps it would suffice to start.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.btcpayserver.org/deployment/thirdpartyhosting&quot;&gt;docs.btcpayserver.org/deployment/thirdpartyhosting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Trusted third parties are security holes. By relying on someone else to manage a server for you, you are potentially exposing yourself to a certain attack vector. The most significant attack vector when using a third party host is that a malicious and technically skilled host can create a forked version of BTCPay Server and modify it so that it either spy on your transactions or replace your xpubkey with his. This means that future payments made to you may end up in a malicious party wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;BTCPay does not allow server hosts to view the stores of other users nor have access to any personal data (except for registration email address). The xpubkey and even balances of other users can’t be seen. However, as mentioned, a malicious third party could modify that by creating a fork that can look like BTCPay on the front but be something completely different in reality. The biggest concern, which happens when using a third-party host (even if the owner of a self-hosted server is not malicious) comes from the nature of the Bitcoin itself. If a user is not running a full node but instead relies on someone else’s node, his transactions can be listened to by the owner of that node.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Teach Bitcoin protocol training is an in-depth program that was inspired from the study of several hundred thousand lines of implementation code. It teaches you both the high and low-level designs of the Bitcoin Protocol, so you can greatly accelerate your journey to becoming a Bitcoin implementation developer or protocol researcher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The build system is based on autotools, so it should just work anywhere where autotools runs. Just run ./autogen.sh ./configure and then make, that’s it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We recently added support for MSVC for Windows developers in the build system. For release builds, we use cross-compilation which is currently only supported on Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;May 7 2019&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We were joined by Mark S. Miller, Chief Scientist at Agoric. Mark is a computer scientist who has done ground-breaking work on many topics relevant to blockchain and smart contracts going back decades.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We discussed his visionary 1988 Agoric papers, which explored how markets could be applied to the world of software. We also covered how his view of smart contracts, which focused on secure bilateral agreements complements and converges with blockchain. Finally, we covered his new company Agoric and their conceptualization of higher order smart contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topics we discussed in this episode&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Mark’s effort to prevent the government from suppressing the discovery of public key cryptography in the 1970s&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The legendary project Xanadu and its attempt to create censorship-resistant web publishing&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Mark’s Agoric papers and the vision of markets for computation&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Why AI hasn’t changed the shortcomings of central planning&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The difference between his view of smart contracts and Nick Szabo’s&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Their decade-spanning work on making JavaScript the best language for smart contracts&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Agoric’s work on higher order smart contracting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;transcript&quot;&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian Fabian Crain&lt;/strong&gt;: So we’re here today with Mark Miller and I actually tried to have Mark on the show around four years ago in 2015, somewhere I had stumbled on his work so he had done this work on kind of smart contracts you know a very long time ago much before Bitcoin and blockchain and all that, and I know that he wasn’t working in the blockchain or Bitcoin space back then but I found his email and and I emailed him and he was at Google at the time and he &lt;em&gt;sent me a talk that he did in 1997&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;video featured below&lt;/em&gt;) about smart contracts and the kind of legal ramifications and technology implications smart contracts which was just amazingly prescient. You would watch the talk and it’s astonishing how many of the ideas that later became you know kind of widely used were there so unfortunately it didn’t happen back then that we had them on but since then Mark has transitioned, he’s left Google and he’s working fully on kind of decentralized networks and digital money and kind of the blockchain space in general. So I’m really excited that you know finally the episode is happening and we’re having you on Mark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark Miller&lt;/strong&gt;: Well I’m very happy to be here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian&lt;/strong&gt;: So to start off I mean you’ve been part of this cipher pong cryptography world for a long time. But like how did you originally become involved in that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark&lt;/strong&gt;: So I’m going to go all the way back to 1977. I was working with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/elab/hfl0155.html&quot;&gt;Ted Nelson on Xanadu&lt;/a&gt;. Xanadu and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/155/87/&quot;&gt;Augment&lt;/a&gt; were the two early hypertext projects. Well before the web. And &lt;a href=&quot;http://xanadu.com/HISTORY/&quot;&gt;Xanadu&lt;/a&gt; was the one that had the vision of worldwide hypertext publishing as the new electronic medium for humanity. And Ted and I were both very influenced by George Orwell 1984 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enotes.com/homework-help/book-1984-what-was-main-role-ministry-truth-720&quot;&gt;ministry of truth&lt;/a&gt; and we understood that the coming world of electronic publishing could be a force for oppression and tyranny or could be a great liberating force giving us all privacy and freedom from censorship. Then we very much wanted to do the second we saw it as our mission to lead the world into the coming of electronic publishing as a liberating force and we didn’t know how to do it. In 1977 Martin Gardner was editing a column for &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/the-top-10-martin-gardner-scientific-american-articles/&quot;&gt;Scientific American named Mathematical Games&lt;/a&gt; and one issue of that column explained the discovery of the first public key algorithm the RSA algorithm. And he did not actually explain the algorithm. He explained the logic of what you could do with a public key system both the &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/246071/description-of-symmetric-and-asymmetric-encryption&quot;&gt;asymmetric encryption&lt;/a&gt; for privacy and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/454048/what-is-the-difference-between-encrypting-and-signing-in-asymmetric-encryption&quot;&gt;asymmetric signing&lt;/a&gt; for integrity. He painted a very nice picture of the power of this. I called Ted up in the middle of the night very excited. Ted we can prevent the Ministry of Truth. We wrote away for &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/Rsapaper.pdf&quot;&gt;the paper&lt;/a&gt;. The paper did not arrive. And we found out that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/984428.Crypto&quot;&gt;the reason it did not arrive&lt;/a&gt; is because the US national security apparatus, some part of it, decided that the paper should not be publicly released. They, I’m going to say classified, I don’t know what the legal category is, but they made it very clear that they would consider it to be illegal to distribute the paper. I got really incensed by this. I got passionate and angry in a way that I have really not in my life before or since feeling quite literally they are going to classify this over my dead body. I went to MIT, hung around campus, managed to get my hands on a paper copy, I was very careful to handle it only with gloves. I took it to various copy shops there were no home copy machines. I made lots of copies at different shops. I put them anonymously into envelopes sending them from a variety of mailboxes sending them out to home and hobbyist computer organizations and magazines all across the country without any cover letter just the the article itself. Fortunately early in 1978 he U.S. government decided to declassify. They gave the green light for distribution of the paper communications of the ACM immediately published the paper in the February 78 issue. And I will never have any idea whether the actions I took had any impact. I don’t have any particular reason to believe they did have an impact. But the experience of doing that of for example with handing copies of the paper to some select friends saying if I disappear make sure this gets out. This was a really radicalizing moment for me. Realizing the power of cryptography to change the world to protect us as individuals from large and oppressive institutions. And that this was worth fighting for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian&lt;/strong&gt;: Such an amazing story and I think it’s hard for people today to conceive this cause today, yes okay somebody writes a paper invents a new science thing they can publish it right so the idea that the government could try to say this information is too important that the people shouldn’t know about this. It’s pretty amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah. There have been several phases of governments of the US government in particular &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smb/classes/s16/l_cryptowars.pdf&quot;&gt;impeding the progress of cryptography&lt;/a&gt; and impeding the progress of decentralized markets smart contract built on cryptography. Export controls lasted till about 1998 the &lt;a href=&quot;http://erights.org/elang/&quot;&gt;E-lang&lt;/a&gt; which was distributed, cryptographic object capability language that which a lot of the language based smart contracting ideas came together. We came out with that language during the era of export controls. So we had to actually split the effort where we where we were distributing it from the U.S. without the cryptography and then Tyler Close a collaborator living on Anguilla, a Canadian citizen, then reverse engineered how to put the crypto back in and the E language was actually distributed from Anguilla during those days. There was also the Clipper Chip trying to get trapdoors in to mandatory trapdoors into cryptography. And then 1998 export controls were lifted and then after 2001 with 9/11 there was the Patriot Act and suddenly this big chill in the air where Doug Jackson from E-Gold, one of the first attempts at doing a cryptographically based currency system in this case backed by physical gold. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2008/07/e-gold-founder/&quot;&gt;He was arrested&lt;/a&gt;. And there was a chilling of the work from that forward. So there was a lot of fighting going on. There was the RSA T-shirts where people would have the RSA algorithm written on a t shirt and go across borders with it all kind of daring people to arrest them because it’s a free speech issue at that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://teespring.com/shop/munitions-t-shirt&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vangogh.teespring.com/v3/image/0R8w-1-KjC570YaNh4vVa2qctsc/480/560.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;digital-cash-early-thoughts-and-work&quot;&gt;Digital Cash: Early Thoughts and Work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian&lt;/strong&gt;: So you talked a little bit about &lt;a href=&quot;http://xanadu.com/HISTORY/&quot;&gt;Xanadu&lt;/a&gt; and how the thing that you guys saw there was this idea of censorship resistant publishing and this amazing you know force it would be in creating freedom. Of course the parallels to a Bitcoin  are like you know astonishing way because people would always speak about okay censorship resist money and basically speak about it in very similar terms. Did you guys back then as early as you know when you started working on Xanadu, already think about okay maybe there should also be something like censorship resistant money and what that could look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark&lt;/strong&gt;: Oh I don’t know that my thinking about cryptographic commerce all the way to cryptographic money goes back that far. I think my first exposure to really strong crypto for money, when did DigiCash first come out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunny&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah I think that was in the 80s, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark&lt;/strong&gt;: OK. At the time we wrote the Agoric assistance papers in 1988. We assumed secure electronic money and micro payments without really exploring how to achieve that was more of assuming that there is some solution to that. Then elaborating and exploring all of the claims of smart contracts, all the kinds of behavioral commercial institutions and auctions and and various kinds of incentive engineering we called it, now called mechanism design. We explored all of that as computational embodiments of contractual arrangements and institutional arrangements assuming that there would be an underlying money system. I did do in my 1987 paper Logical Secrets, a really terrible first attempt at a distributed secure money. But the idea of doing a money with no central issuer like blockchain has, I did not see anything like blockchain coming. I was much more thinking in terms of like Hayek’s paper on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/denationalisation.pdf&quot;&gt;denationalization of money&lt;/a&gt; where you have many separate currencies competing with each other. And this is in general a theme I’m going to come back to which is in general my approach was decentralized not the way in which people in the Bitcoin space in the blockchain space referred to decentralized which is mutually suspicious parties all coordinating together to arrive at consensus on single decisions. That’s one form of decentralization it’s called a coordinated decentralization. I was much more thinking what I’ll call &lt;a href=&quot;http://faculty.babson.edu/krollag/org_site/org_theory/Scott_articles/weick_lcs.html&quot;&gt;loosely coupled decentralization&lt;/a&gt; which is what we see in the Internet, what we see in the web, where there’s tremendous architectural diversity, there’s there’s essentially no decisions that everyone has to jointly make and nationalization of money was basically saying the same thing with money. Let many monies compete with each other, let reputation feedback and competition drive the system towards emergent robustness so any one money might fail but if it fails the competition and drive customers to other monies. And we saw that as a model for commerce in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunny&lt;/strong&gt;: Brian and I actually chatted once with James Dale Davidson who wrote the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sovereign-Individual-Mastering-Transition-Information/dp/0684832720&quot;&gt;The Sovereign Individual&lt;/a&gt; and a lot of people you know try to draw a lot of parallels between his work and Bitcoin . But you know that work he’s actually talking you know talking about decentralized money in a very similar way that you are like he talked about cryptographic money but he actually really had the idea that there’ll be many many private issuances of money like a Swiss bank will issue its own money backed by gold and people will issue their own money and then users will kind of choose which money they want to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;szabo-vs-miller&quot;&gt;Szabo vs Miller&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah and in the mid 90s Dean Tribble, who’s now one of the founders with me of Agoric, and had been collaborating with me all the way all the way back into the late 80s. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/deantribble&quot;&gt;Dean Tribble&lt;/a&gt; and Norm Hardy creator of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2008/readings/keykos-osr.pdf&quot;&gt;KeyKOS&lt;/a&gt; object capability operating system, the two of them came out with a decentralized payments proposal. You can think of it as decentralized money called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.16.9665&quot;&gt;Digital Silk Road&lt;/a&gt; which was basically routing payments through paralysed bilateral relationships which bilateral relationship has a credit window, so I won’t go into it, it has many similarities to what Interledger is now doing. But the main point is that it really was this hyper decentralized in a loosely coupled manner system of payments but then as you accumulated imbalances each bilateral relationship you’d have to clear the imbalance through something else and that something else was just so assumed to be of a variety of competing real world money with no new insight as to how to make those cryptographic. So I want to give a special credit here to Nick Szabo, because during this period of 90s first of all his vision of smart contract was of tremendous influence on me but also the kind of thing that we now understand from blockchain. Nick Szabo was trying to explain the power of that to me and I wasn’t understanding it and I did not understand it until I saw blockchain and I understood how Bitcoin  and Ethereum work. And then there was this ‘aha’, that’s what Nick was talking about all this time. So while I was thinking about the emergent robustness from competition and reputation feedback you know loosely coupled network where any one point can fail, looking at, inspired by the dynamics of the marketplace in terms of what happens between businesses, Nick was very focused on the internal controls by which a large institution can by having internal controls and public audits and well-designed governance systems and separation of duties, you can build an individual institution that can be much more trustworthy than any of the individuals in it. And Nick understood that things like byzantine fault tolerance, like massive replication with cross check and consensus mechanisms is kind of the extreme form of internal control so that we can now build a logical individual institution that is much more trustworthy than anything humanity has been able to build before and there’s some kind of contracts for which that’s needed and one for which it’s most needed which was highest leverage is money and it’s no accident, I think that we saw it emerge first with cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunny&lt;/strong&gt;: Specifically at least from money issuance. Like you said, I like to call that the distributed version, the distributed version kind of took, the intellectual protocol is sounds very very similar to what you’re talking about here. But then &lt;a href=&quot;https://interledger.org/rfcs/0003-interledger-protocol/&quot;&gt;Interledger&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t have like a native money and it kind of assumes the existence of some other settlement mechanism. But on Nick Szabo’s vision it seems that yes this is good for coin issuance but at the end of the day maybe payments don’t need to be on this, what I think is actually really interesting is that the Lightning network seems like a combination of these two ideas where you use a base redundant system for issuance and then you try to use a distributed system for payments and you can also use the base system along with issuance as a message board or this reputation right. One of the issues I always had with Interledger is yes it assumes the existence of reputation but where does this reputation go. Is there a bulletin board where I can go tell everyone that hey look this guy screwed me over. There isn’t. And so that’s one of the things that a redundant blockchain also gives you that’s kind of what Lightning does where like you know if you want to challenge someone you can challenge them on the base chain. I think it’s kind of cool to see that both your vision and Nick Szabo’s are kind of both correct impartially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah. It took me a long time to see that. I think that’s exactly correct. I want to give a shout out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/jorge-lopez-14100696/&quot;&gt;Jorge Lopez&lt;/a&gt; who had studied both what was going on a blockchain as well as my old papers and he came to me with the integrated vision and then I saw that oh it’s not that Nick’s vision and my vision are alternatives or competing with each other. They actually fit together and they’re actually about different layers of the system. And that very much inspired what Agoric is now doing. My new company. So the way we see the combined vision is that you still want the overall system to be a loosely coupled network of mutually suspicious machines hosting mutually suspicious computation talking to each other. But now we can view a blockchain as a way to build a computer out of agreement rather than building it out of hardware, by building it out of agreement we now have a logical computer that’s much more trustworthy than any one physical piece of hardware can. But now it’s still that logical computer is just one node on a much larger network and that larger network can include other communication secure communication between chains secure communication between chains and not chains. So while the kinds of coordination we were doing with cryptographic protocols in a loosely coupled distributed system we can now do that as well on top of blockchains include blockchains within that overall fabric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah. No I think it’s very nice how you explain this and one of two ways that kind of comes to my mind when the way you speak about it is that you can think of you know often one talks about blockchains about you know removing a third party. But in a way the blockchain is a third party it’s just that decentralized third party. So in many ways maybe the way economic interactions work is not that different from the existing world. It’s just that the centralized third party of the decentralized third party whereas you’re where it kind of goes into you know more in a way it’s a more radical direction in that it’s actually decentralized you don’t have the third party so much anymore and then of course if you bring the two together that you have maybe some of these architectural differences in terms of the way the interactions works. And then when you need a third party you have a decentralized third party. So yeah I think it’s super fascinating how you have this kind of different ideas and different ways so they’re playing out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah I think that that there is there is some small number of institutions, like money like Augur is another great example of worldwide prediction market where you need worldwide credibility without prior negotiation but most contracts are local and they don’t need to run on a globally credible blockchain. And the transactions that they do they can do against local representations of remotely pegged money. Which is what several parties including Cosmos are doing what we’re doing and what Lightning is doing where the transactions that don’t need to themselves be on the blockchain can happen much faster and much more privately and then the outcome of the transactions can roll up in to net inflows and net outflows and have those have them roll up the outcomes, eventually roll up into public blockchains without having to reveal what the contracts were that they rolled up from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;agoric-open-computing&quot;&gt;Agoric Open Computing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian&lt;/strong&gt;: So you wrote a set of paper called like &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourcecrypto.pub/posts/agoric/papers-miller-drexler/&quot;&gt;Agoric Open Computing&lt;/a&gt; I think. And there were three different papers and they had quite a lot of you know widely read and they had some impact. I think. So you mind walking us through what are the core ideas that you were exploring in these papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark&lt;/strong&gt;: There are three papers. The central paper is the one called &lt;a href=&quot;https://e-drexler.com/d/09/00/AgoricsPapers/agoricpapers/aos/aos.0.html&quot;&gt;Markets and Computation Agoric Open Systems&lt;/a&gt;. And that’s the one where we really go through all of the layers of our vision and how each layer builds on the previous layer and arguing for why our foundational layer was necessary to support the higher layers. So at the lower layer we talk about computational &lt;a href=&quot;https://e-drexler.com/d/09/00/AgoricsPapers/agoricpapers/aos/aos.4.html&quot;&gt;foundations&lt;/a&gt; distributed computational foundations with encapsulation and communication of information access and resources. And that’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.erights.org/history/joule/MANUAL.B10.pdf&quot;&gt;encapsulation communication&lt;/a&gt; is very much sort of the centerpiece of object capabilities encapsulation is a form of property rights from ownership. Communication is a form of rights transfer. So together they form a core rights theory. Information access and resources maps very cleanly to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.certmike.com/confidentiality-integrity-and-availability-the-cia-triad/&quot;&gt;confidentiality integrity and availability&lt;/a&gt;. Integrity turned out to be the core issue that most of our later work through the decades has been on so object capabilities at the low level and then smart contracting and markets and auctions for dynamic price discovery and adaptive price based behavior including with regard to applying the invisible hand to resource allocation issues, things like auctioning off the next CQ time slots. Having markets in space. And network bandwidth. And then on top of that a vision of how the coming of distributed decentralized electronic markets covering the world would be enmeshed with and part of the human economy and really change the nature of the human economy. So that was the central paper. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://e-drexler.com/d/09/00/AgoricsPapers/agoricpapers/ie/ie0.html&quot;&gt;incentive engineering&lt;/a&gt; paper, that’s the one where we actually sort of go into the to the detailed design of some core auction mechanisms for doing this allocation and some game theoretic analysis of it. And the term incentive engineering we didn’t know about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mechanism-design-theory.asp&quot;&gt;mechanism design&lt;/a&gt; literature but that’s just our term for what has otherwise been called mechanism design. And then the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourcecrypto.pub/posts/agoric/papers-miller-drexler/#comparative-ecology-a-computational-perspective&quot;&gt;Comparative Ecology&lt;/a&gt;, a Computational Perspective is another kind of big picture paper. This one taking a look at various complex adaptive systems that we see in the world, systems in which coherence emerges from a process that we’d call some kind of evolutionary ecosystem. So we looked at real world human marketplaces. We looked at biological ecosystems. We looked at some A.I. systems that were making internal use of evolutionary adaptation, Driscoll in particular, and we were trying to compare and contrast them in order to learn what is the framework that would best create the selective pressure from which distributed problem solving would emerge and we very much supported the use of market mechanisms as a robust system of selective pressure to encourage this emergent growth of problem solving ability. So those were the three papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunny&lt;/strong&gt;: What was the context of these papers and so you co-authored these with Eric Drexler. And so for people who don’t know he’s often called the father of nanotechnology. And so you know that seems very far off from some of the stuff that you are working on and so I guess how did you meet with Eric Drexler and how did you guys decide to write these three papers together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark&lt;/strong&gt;: So Eric and I have very aligned visions of the future. And when I first met Eric he was working on light sales, basically &lt;a href=&quot;https://foresight.org/solar-sailing/&quot;&gt;solar sails&lt;/a&gt; for propulsion in space. He was presenting it at a space conference. I was working with Ted on Xanadu. I think this was the late 70s, 79 maybe at the Princeton space industrialization conference and I explained to him about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scihi.org/ted-nelson-xanadu-hypertext-system/&quot;&gt;hypertext and about Xanadu&lt;/a&gt; and his jaw kind of dropped open and he said do you know how important that is. And I actually learned to appreciate hypertext through his view of it. He saw value in hypertext that none of the rest of us had and really deepened our view of what was so great about it. So we were talking about all sorts of things but we were thinking in terms of a much higher tech future a higher tech future that would have for example the scale of computation that we would have with nanotech based computers which is still many orders of magnitude beyond the scale of computation we have today. And it was clear to us that at that scale of computation the central planning approach to coordination would not work and that you needed something decentralized where the overall goodness of the system emerged through loosely coupled decentralization through a coherent framework of rules. And it was that future orientation and also our fascination. There was another critical breakthrough also which came from, I was explaining to Eric my excitement about object oriented programming. And when I explained to Eric about the power of encapsulation in object oriented programming he said oh that’s like Hayek’s explanation of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.libertarianism.org/publications/essays/property-rights-key-economic-development&quot;&gt;utility of property rights&lt;/a&gt;. And that was a big aha moment for me. It was that a ha moment I think more than anything else that led to the Agoric work. So there’s many virtues of property rights but the one that Hayek explained is in terms of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.erights.org/talks/promises/paper/tgc05.pdf&quot;&gt;plan interference&lt;/a&gt; is that the central problem of economics is how is it that all of these separate creatures (people) with all their various intentions and mostly ignorant of each other formulate plans whether these plans are to serve their interests and to unfold in a world that in which the plans of other agents that have been formulated in mutual ignorance of each other are all unfolding together. How do you keep these plans from interfering with each other. And Hayek said one element is that by dividing up the resources into separately owned parcels, where each planning agent knows that there are some resources that he has exclusive access to, he can formulate some plans minimizing plan interference with other agents. Well that’s exactly the object oriented understanding of encapsulation is a way to enable programs that are formulated separately to be able to operate on their own encapsulated data free from interference by each other and that enables these separately formulated plans to be composed together. To realize co-operative opportunities from the composition while still minimizing the dangers of destructive interference with each other. So that understanding made both of our understanding of Hayek’s point and our understanding of object orientation deeper and led to the appreciation of object capabilities as a form of encapsulation coordination that is not just minimizing the dangers of accidental interference but also minimizing the dangers of purposeful interference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;decentralized-planning&quot;&gt;Decentralized Planning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian&lt;/strong&gt;: Okay. So this is a very interesting concept so let me try to dive into this a little bit. So you said that OK if all of these you know very powerful computers let’s say if nanocomputers and stuff then this central planning approach wouldn’t work anymore with computing. But it seems like the way you’re speaking about it is let’s say I have a company, my company has various different employees and resources and stuff like that. Now within that company obviously there is that kind of a central planning approach right. That’s sort of the nature of companies right. You say OK there’s markets between all the companies but then within each company there is the central planning approach and then I guess there was the work by Ronald Coase and stuff about what determines the size of these firms into kind of transaction costs but are you basically saying that if you think of the different components of a computer program or computer architecture all of them should interact with some market mechanisms. And if that’s the case how does that align with property rights. Does it make sense let’s say for a company to own all of these computing resources and then there still being some market where all of these competing computing resources interact, you know sort of making payments and trying to maximize their profits and stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark&lt;/strong&gt;: So that’s a big question has many parts to it. First part of answering it is that I think that price and adaptive price behavior is not the important early step. I think the important early step is a system of rights based coordination so that things that are formulated separately mostly in ignorance of each other can still be composed together that people can create reusable libraries where there is in the computational fabric a notion of separately owned data and resources so that we can compose reusable components and get larger outcomes. And the modern richness of software I think has largely been based on kind of informal hacking imperfect insecure rights based theory of coordination. This is the encapsulation of conventional object oriented programming. And within a company you also have imperfect systems of that are like prices. You have for example on a single machine you have various forms of priority, on a Google data center you’ve also got various priority and urgency knobs and resource allocation knobs and all of these are self reported. There is some if you want to think of it as a central planning scheduler you can do that or you can think of it as an analogue of an auction mechanism, but it’s not a central planner in the sense of it making the decisions about what priority other things should have. Rather all of the other things self report their priority very much the way players in a market express priority by using money and produce price information. So this is kind of a cheap analogue of prices. And the reason why you can get along both with insecure encapsulation and imperfect price mechanisms within a company is because the company has various kinds of sanctions. Everyone within the company is trying to cooperate with each other. If someone is seen as too abusive you’re taking advantage then the company has other ways to react. So companies have strong admission controls whereas as soon as you expose this to the outside market now you don’t have those other forms of feedback you need genuine protected objects, protected boundaries, and you need for example Ethereum with the gas system has to have a genuinely robust system of selling resources, not so much in order to have efficient resource allocation but in order to have not horrible service allocations not so much a question of optimizing it’s a question of deep pessimism. It’s a question of avoiding the really terrible behavior. And companies internally have other ways to avoid the really terrible behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunny&lt;/strong&gt;: So I’m actually really glad you mentioned Google’s data centers as an example here because I read an article a few weeks ago talking about how Google’s actually using their deep mind A.I. to coordinate energy resources within its data centers and that this experiment of theirs actually reduced their cooling costs by 40 percent. And so do you think that centrally planned maybe humans aren’t the best way of doing central planning. Maybe this leads into a larger political question but do you think A.I’s are on the brink of being better central planners than both markets and human central planners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark&lt;/strong&gt;: So first of all I want to say I don’t know the particular system that you’re talking about I know a lot about how Google operates more conventionally before they started applying a deep mind technology to this issue. But I also just want to mention, sort of a reasoning by analogy here. Back in the 1940s and 1950s in the socialist planning debate when Hayek and Mises would talk about the what unfortunately came to be known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mises.org/wire/socialism-calculation-problem-not-knowledge-problem-0&quot;&gt;calculation problem&lt;/a&gt;. What came to be known in later years as a knowledge problem. But the calculation problem it was well you can’t centralize the knowledge needed for a central planner to act. That’s the knowledge part of it. And then there’s no possible way you can build a central planner, you can create a central planning institution that would act. And back then the advocates of central planning were pointing at look at these new fangled computers. Surely these computers will grow up into central planning agents and they can solve the calculation problem and now we can do central planning and the thing that the asymmetry. There is a false asymmetry that was assumed there which is they were imagining the market of the day with the complexity of the market that they knew and imagining that the planners were much more capable than the planners of the day because they were using computers but they didn’t imagine that the markets would also have players that were using computers and therefore were all much more complex and interesting. And in fact the knowledge problem gets worse not better as the individual players get more sophisticated and embody more knowledge that they’re also not able to articulate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunny&lt;/strong&gt;: You get almost to a turing problem there where you know the central planner computer can’t simulate all of the millions of computers in today’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark&lt;/strong&gt;: Right. So with regard to the deep mind thing once again I don’t know that specifically but what I’ll react to is the thing that it’s planning is about temperature and power and such things. And that’s also not a set of resource allocation decisions that programmers have been writing their programs to deal with. It just hasn’t been on the radar traditionally so that there is no local decision making by programs to try to be adaptive on those regards. So it’s essentially a situation where we had no decentralized planning and very poor centralized planning. So it’s a situation where planning so badly that even a central planner can do better. Once you’ve got that kind of sophistication in the agents that are subject to the plans and they are now also as capable of reasoning about those issues. Then you have to again ask does the asymmetry go away where the central planner has gotten special technology ahead of all of the agents that are subject to its control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian&lt;/strong&gt;: That’s really nice how you explained this and I must say I find it kind of encouraging knowing that if this is true and it’s going to hold true then maybe it is something that will kind of work counter towards some of decentralizing aspects that come with A.I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;human-utility-function&quot;&gt;Human Utility Function&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunny&lt;/strong&gt;: And so then one last question I have about the papers before we you know I want to go back into talking with their core company. But what about the fact that when Hayke talks about you know, part of the issue I think is that humans are very complex beings that it’s part of the measurement problem or information problem as you phrased it was how do you measure people’s utility function. We don’t have a way of doing that. But when we’re talking about bots here like you know just computers I feel like at least until we have very strong A.I’s they don’t seem very complex creatures and so I think it might be possible to model these simplistic bots rather than humans and so I don’t know if some of Hayek’s ideas around this complexity of humans comes into play or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark&lt;/strong&gt;: The notion of utility function I think is very much like the notion of the perfectly spherical cow. There is this complex real world both for people and of programs where what you’ve got is behavior that has been shaped over time to be adaptive and serves some interests and then you have outside the system using the concept of the utility function as one way of idealizing the behavior to reason about it. But there is no representation in the person’s head or in the program over a utility function. Programs have complex behavior that are written by programmers and modified by programmers over time to adapt to whatever the complex job is that the program is doing, both with respect to what the job is and with respect to how the program is performing the job and the programmers modify and change it in complex ways to just be more adaptive. And it’s very hard to reason about programs what we know is that it’s impossible in general to predict what a program will do other than by running. So then our computer systems run the programs discover what they do by running them. But I wouldn’t call that central planning I would call that just a distributed system of the running programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunny&lt;/strong&gt;: Cool and to lead back into the blockchain stuff, one of the things that interested me about this property rights. You know I think in the blockchain space we have two very prominent models of property rights and transaction fees that are kind of dominating right now and are very different. You have the first one which is done by Bitcoin  and Ethereum where there’s a limited amount of block space or gas limit and people use fees to basically it’s essentially going in a constant auction where there’s a limited amount of block space and if you want to get in you have to put in a fee and the highest number of people get their fees and you know there’s a lot of innovation going around on that front like Vitalik has a proposal for doing different type of auction mechanisms and whatnot but then there’s a complete other and which I think this is one of the few interesting things that EOS actually did, was they proposed a more property rights based model of fee. So the more EOS tokens you have you get, for simplicity’s sake you could say that if you own 5 percent of the EOS tokens you have the right to use 5 percent of the EOS blockchain’s resources, you have 5 percent of the disk space, 5 percent of the computation power, and so that takes almost a more property rights approach rather than this constant auction. So what are your thoughts on these two approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark&lt;/strong&gt;: So I don’t know the EOS approach. I also don’t know of Vitalik’s recent proposals. Right now we don’t have good composable systems of &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub40673&quot;&gt;electronic rights&lt;/a&gt;. And I think that that’s really sort of the prior issue. So in that sense I’m responding positively to what you said about EOS even though I don’t know the actual EOS system. Having a foundation in rights and rights transfer is I think the right conceptual starting point such that markets emerge from interaction between multiple parties within a rules based rights based framework. And obviously auctions is one way to do that. A proportional share ownership rights is another way to do that. All of these things are worth exploring. I don’t have a strong opinion that one is better than the other. I will say that that Agoric is planning to implement the escalator algorithm for scheduling on the Agoric blockchain but we also want to encourage all sorts of different experiments there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;agoric-object-capabilities-secure-smart-contracts&quot;&gt;Agoric, Object Capabilities, Secure Smart Contracts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian&lt;/strong&gt;: Okay. This is perfect because this kind of leading us exactly where I wanted to go. So I mean there were the papers many years ago that had the name Agoric in it but then much more recently also you co-founded a new company that is also called &lt;a href=&quot;https://agoric.com&quot;&gt;Agoric&lt;/a&gt;, so can you tell us a little bit what is the main vision of the company what are you guys trying to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark&lt;/strong&gt;: So what we’re trying to accomplish is to bring the world economy online. And right now there is a problem which is the blockchain space, the world of smart contracting that we’re seeing, has not been successful at penetrating the mainstream economy. But it’s basically this separate world and the business activities in the mainstream economy see a barrier there that they’re not getting over. So markets are all about network effect. We want to create a distributed system of objects in contracts on different platforms, blockchains, non blockchains, permission quantum systems, individual machines, both publicly and within companies, we want to span that entire network of activity in a uniform framework of at the low level object capabilities, and then at the high level the system of electronic rights and smart contracts that we want to build on top of that. And the result is that we want to enable the mainstream economy to be able to take incremental steps towards adoption of the technology where all of the steps towards complete public participation are as smooth as possible. I want to make an analogy here which is the web as we think of it is mostly a public thing. But the fact that companies inside their firewalls have their own internal private web sites and the content on those websites freely link into public pages and people inside the company following the links go from internet pages navigate to external pages in this completely seamless manner. That’s good for the public web and it’s good for the spread of the technology to apply to things for which public visibility is not appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian&lt;/strong&gt;: And so do you see a similar function that Agoric will have in that people can kind of seamlessly go from traditional means of doing commerce to blockchain base and this kind of friction goes away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes there are several barriers. One of the biggest ones is that smart contracting right now is too hard and too dangerous. We’ve seen smart contracts constructed by experts in which hundreds of millions of dollars have disappeared overnight with no recourse due to simple bugs. And in order to open this world to the mainstream you have to make it much more reasonable for programmers who are not experts on smart contract and programmers whose experts line their subject matter to be able to create business arrangements contracts institutions with much greater confidence that their contracts mean what they think they mean. And our approach with object capabilities and rights which I’ll get back to in a moment, helps tremendously in creating system of of compositional reusable contract components that enable that kind of construction with confidence. We did a lot of this exploration I mentioned in my e language, starting in 2007 I’ve been on the JavaScript standards committee getting the enablers of that into the JavaScript standard. So JavaScript now supports a subset which is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://ocapjs.org&quot;&gt;object capability subset of JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; that essentially includes most of JavaScript such that many old JavaScript programs run in SAS as we call it, secure acme script, which comes out of work we did at Google and now it’s work that Agoric has done in collaboration with Salesforce. So the result is that we’re bringing this to programmers not just as an extension of the object oriented paradigm that people already know so that they can extend the intuitions they already have about objects, but we’re even bringing it to them in a language that 20 million programmers are already familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunny&lt;/strong&gt;: How does this relate to the language you guys have been creating with this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Agoric/Jessie&quot;&gt;Jessie&lt;/a&gt; idea, is that related.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes it is. So there’s two subsets of JavaScript that we’ve defined, a very large subset we call SAS and a very small subset we call Jesse. Jesse itself as a subset of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Agoric/SES&quot;&gt;SES&lt;/a&gt;. In doing secure programming there are sort of two fundamental stances you can take with regard to theirs. I want to protect myself for misbehavior by your code. And I want to ensure that my code means what it thinks it means and in particular when I express security policy in my code how my code should let’s say enforce certain arrangements on your code, bBut I want to know that my code is interacting with your code in the way that I think my code was designed. So SAS is designed to solve the first problem. Which is that I can run your code that I don’t trust inside a SAS sandbox under object capability rules where I am confident that your code has only gotten the authority that I intended to give it, that your code cannot escape the sandbox, cannot do things with more authority than it was given. And because Jesse is a subset of SAS your code might be in Jesse. But if I’m just protecting myself from your code I don’t care whether you stayed within Jesse or whether you’re using for full SAS. For my code JavaScript has many hazards. Double equal for example, the famous one, that has crazy coercion rules so everybody’s programming style for JavaScript says avoid Double equals. So in Jesse we just define a subset that omits all of the unnecessarily dangerous things, only includes the best parts, and the wonderful thing is that the best parts JavaScript are a really good programming language. So we’ve been essentially keeping our code in Jesse. We expect to be also we’ve been collaborating with academics on formal specification languages so that you can verify that object capability code means what you think it means and we think Jesse is the candidate to apply those tools to. That’s how those things fit together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian&lt;/strong&gt;: Okay great. So yeah that’s very interesting so all your work on JavaScript and secure JavaScript and how that’s kind of coming together. So you spoke a bit about JavaScript and how you guys enabled smart contracts there but what is powerful about this approach and what are the kind of capabilities that this approach that you guys take the smart contracting has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark&lt;/strong&gt;: So one of the things that makes our current world of software so rich and so composable is higher order composition and what I mean by that is we start with higher order functions where functions can operate on data and compute things can operate on values but the functions themselves are values so higher order functional programming is where functions operate on functions but with no limitation. Objects cause effects, take actions, and objects can also hold and manipulate other objects. So a table can store any kind of object but then when you reapply a concept like a table into an object then you enable the kinds of things that objects manipulate to be also the kind of thing that the manipulation is. Likewise in the marketplace, much of the richness of the market interactions we have is the reaffication nature of property rights, that property rights started off very literal. But then anytime you create a contract that unfolds over time, the continued participation in the contract is itself valuable and by labelling that continued participation, a property right, then any contract building block that’s generic and parameterizable over anything that’s described as a property right can now operate on the rights created by other contracts and you can compose contracts together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunny&lt;/strong&gt;: As an example, I can imagine an options contract where an options contract is basically me making a contract with you saying hey I want the ability to buy this from you at a later date. But then I can turn this contract into an asset itself and I can go resell my end of the options contract. And so you turn contracts into assets and you can make contract out of those assets and you can have this innovative approach where contracts and assets are kind of interchangeable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark&lt;/strong&gt;: That’s right. So we talk about the duality of contracts and e-rights, contracts manipulate e-rights and contracts that unfold over time create e-rights. And ERTP the electronic rights transfer protocol is the top protocol layer in our system and it’s essentially a set of object interfaces and specifications for generically representing a wide range of kinds of rights. Rights that are fungible and non-functional, divisible, so many non-functional things and the right to continue participating in contracts within our framework are all redefined as rights described by ERTP, and then to the extent possible we create contract components that assume the rights that manipulating that only assume that they’re described by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.erights.org/talks/ertp/index.html&quot;&gt;ERTP&lt;/a&gt;, you can’t always do that but we can do that with exchange you can do that with options and futures you can do that with a variety of auctions, single auctions, continuous double auctions. So we have this tremendous opportunity to create highly reusable generically parameter risebale contract components in which you can feed any &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Agoric/ERTP&quot;&gt;ERTP&lt;/a&gt; described contract and then if that contract unfolds over time then it creates a new derivative right that in turn can be fed into other contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fin&quot;&gt;FIN&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunny&lt;/strong&gt;: Right. And so for our listeners who want to get a much better understanding of this, I highly recommend one of Mark’s papers he wrote called &lt;a href=&quot;http://erights.org/elib/capability/ode/ode-bearer.html&quot;&gt;Financial Instruments As Capabilities&lt;/a&gt;, and to me when I was first trying to understand this whole capability stuff and it didn’t make sense but then after reading that paper it had a little bit of pseudocode in there and it’s like okay reading that I’m like okay now I see how this makes sense and I can visualize how to put these pieces together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark&lt;/strong&gt;: The actual title is &lt;a href=&quot;https://allquantor.at/blockchainbib/pdf/miller2000capability.pdf&quot;&gt;Capability Based Financial Instruments&lt;/a&gt;. It was published in Financial Cryptography 2000, which by the way also occurred on Anguilla which became a little haven of crypto activity initially because of the export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunny&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah so we’ll definitely link to that in the show notes. And so then another question I want to ask was, now you have this ERTP system and this Jesse smart contracting language, you could have went ahead and created a simple smart contracting platform like Ethereum or Tezos or you know any of these systems, but it seems you guys are not just creating a single blockchain contracting platform. Could you talk a bit briefly about what the goal there is with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark&lt;/strong&gt;: So again it’s network effect. And it goes back to the differing early visions of hypertext. I hadn’t thought to make this analogy before but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/155/87/&quot;&gt;Doug Engelbart’s Augment&lt;/a&gt; system was kind of a single system for those who signed up to Augment. Whereas Xanadu was a worldwide distributed loosely coupled hypertext publishing system where there’s no one provider. We want to enable. contracts that span from the one extreme of completely permissionless globally credible blockchains all the way to various systems that are more private. But one of the things that I think is really important is most contracts are local. Most need for contracts are local, most actual real world contracting is local. There’s no need to create worldwide transparency into the internals of a contract that’s done by a small set of parties. And then there’s a few arrangements which I would call more institutions than contracts, that do need that credibility, we want to span that whole range. There is this large tradeoff space. We want one uniform mechanism that can sit on top of that diversity and span it and enable contracts that started off being designed for one place in that fabric to be able to be moved and continue execution in another place on that fabric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian&lt;/strong&gt;: Cool. Well thanks so much Mark. I think that there’s so much there to talk about and then dive into and there’s a lot of resources we talked about that we’ll put in the episode links so if people want to dive in there’s definitely plenty to keep someone busy for weeks or months. Yeah and we’re very much looking forward to seeing what comes out in terms of practical use cases from Agoric and hopefully we can do another episode at some point in the future. So thanks so much for joining us today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my first attempt at organizing information related specifically to Bitcoin. We also have &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourcecrypto.pub/archive/development/bitcoin-dev/&quot;&gt;Bitcoin Dev&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourcecrypto.pub/archive/crypto/btc-layer2/&quot;&gt;BTC-Layer2&lt;/a&gt; channels that must be sorted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, much of the contents of the source crypto Discord Server are bitcoin related, but organized into channels by topic. Where there might be articles about other cryptosystems and bitcoin together on that particular subject. For now, I’m working on filling out this page, weeding out some stale links, organizing, and also working on separate pages for practical Bitcoin. Later, I can comb through the SourceCrypto Discord server and gradually fill the new Bitcoin Nerds server, then port it to its own website just like here on &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/research-index/&quot;&gt;SourceCrypto&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have created a new Discord Server for organizing information related to Bitcoin called:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;btc-nerds&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.gg/GAVs9Kd&quot;&gt;BTC-Nerds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I’m gradually moving all Bitcoin content to it’s own home with no distractions, that will have its own web-site soon too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any ideas for a better logo than that, which will be visible in small icon form like an avitar, we will be grateful!!!!! :D I was trying to use the B of the Bitcoin logo to look like nerd glasses… which I fell flat w acheiving… but I don’t mind it too bad just to have a temporary icon for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.gg/GAVs9Kd&quot;&gt;discord server&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoin.org&quot;&gt;Bitcoin.org&lt;/a&gt; is still a great resource, we feel that recent events are damaging Bitcoin.org’s neutrality. Furthermore, the maintainers and domain owners have, over the past few years, been taking unilateral actions which go against the wishes of and occurred without the consent of the community. These actions have been driving away frequent contributors to the project.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As a result of these, we have decided to launch btcinformation.org as a community maintained fork of Bitcoin.org. The goal of this site is to be a neutral, informational resource about Bitcoin and how to use Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The insecurity discussion starts near the bottom of page 2 of the paper The security issues the paper discusses are pretty simple to solve theoretically, but they all increase the communication complexity of the signing schemes from O(n^2) to O(n^3) Which means there’s that many more points at which the multisig can be sabotaged or an error of some sort can occur Which basically means that all of those schemes are useless for large numbers of participants Not that they were that useful for any significant number of participants with a complexity of O(n^2)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In this talk Pieter went into the benefits of these ideas and discussed an upcoming proposal for a first step that combines a subset of these ideas. Some ideas will be left for future extensions, in order to avoid complexity and limiting the design space. Yet, this would bring privacy and flexibility benefits to Bitcoin, as well as moderate scaling advantages. The main focus is Taproot, which has the potential to make all outputs look identical, by merging pay-to-pubkey and pay-to-scripthash into one - but other changes will be needed to make it widely applicable and efficient.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Over the past year, the prevailing thought among many in the cryptocurrency communities is that bitcoin is not keeping up with other coins. That somehow bitcoin was being intentionally crippled, or that the developers did not know what they were doing. As we are seeing with the bitcoin dominance going up, that prevailing thought was wrong. The coins who were supposedly going to kill bitcoin have been all but abandoned in many cases. Many others are in the process of dying a slow death (which may take years to fully play out).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Abstract.This paper presents an extension to Bitcoin’s script language enabling covenants, a primitive that allows transactions to restrict howthe value they transfer is used in the future. Covenants expand the set offinancial instruments expressible in Bitcoin, and enable new powerful andnovel use cases. We illustrate two novel security constructs built usingcovenants.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Bitcoin blockchain is not known for its ability to enable smart contracts. In fact, most developers creating smart contracts use a different blockchain, like Ethereum. But the truth is that the Bitcoin protocol can be used to create smart contracts. Particl.io, the blockc…&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Bitcoin’s capacity is limited. Meanwhile, smart contracts can be resource intensive. So even though Bitcoin has always supported basic smart contract functionality, the two have never been a natural match.But a recent topic of research spearheaded by Blockstream mathematici…&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Decentralization is only a means to an end—the end being 21,000,000 #Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Nothing else matters.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;For if Bitcoin becomes centralized, the first thing to follow is inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;In the last years, a lot has been written about the “huge waste of energy” resulting from Bitcoin’s Proof of Work (PoW). In this series of four posts, we‘re going to challenge this widespread opinion by questioning the main metrics used to highlight the alleged increasing inefficiency of Bitcoin’s PoW.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;In this first part, we‘ll first discuss the main utility of PoW in the Bitcoin protocol. Then, after a reminder of two important properties of Bitcoin’s PoW, we’ll define a mathematical formalization of this utility (Bitcoin.Days Secured) and we’ll use it to define two new metrics (Unit Cost and Average Cost). At last, we’ll check what these metrics can teach us about the evolution of the efficiency of Bitcoin’s PoW over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The UTXO set is a growing problem. We had a talk this morning about dust in the UTXO talk. We have about 60 million UTXOs. The problem is that as we heard in the talk before, the blockchain is quite an inefficient data structure for UTXOs because if I want to download an old block, I need all the blockheaders in between. If I want to download an old transaction and check if it’s unspent and I only have the head of the blockchain, then I need to check all the inbetween transactions and check if they spend my transaction or not.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;We have been experimenting with Lightning (Bitcoin) payments. But is it ready for commerce applications? Here’s what we think…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;li&gt;Ways I can tell LN routing is not a mature market yet: - I’m charging 25x more than anyone and routing more than ever before - The largest capacity owner assigns capacity at random - Almost no one charges any fees at all for routing - Most public nodes aren’t even reli…&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Recent interviews given by @roasbeef @bitconner and tweets by @alexbosworth confirm my initial theory about the potential for operating a profitable Lightning node: payment channel management skill is the primary driver of profits. Merely staking capital ensures nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In theory, the Lightning Network could potentially perform “seamless” currency conversions, allowing a payer to spend one currency to pay a payee requesting for another currency.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;However, a significant technical barrier prevents implementation of such feature as of current designs (late 2018) for Lightning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Bitcoin’s governance matters because Bitcoin is the first successful, most liquid, and most widely known crypto-currency. In the words of Michael Goldstein, “Sound money is a foundational pillar of civilization, and Bitcoin restores this powerful tool for social coordination.” If Bitcoin’s governance model is flawed, it could prevent Bitcoin from reaching its full potential. If Bitcoin’s governance is flawed, Bitcoin’s stakeholders should work to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Let’s revisit important milestones in how we experienced Bitcoin HODLing over the past 10 years, and what we can expect from 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;In this post, I’m not talking about custodial “vaults” — exchanges and wallets that hold crypto on the customer’s behalf — nor all the security faux-pas and breaches that happened in custody. This is merely my appreciation for the development of the sovereign Bitcoiner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be diving deeper into ObCap, Elang, and Agoric over the coming months. In the mean-time, I had a moment to review and create this directory to the Agoric Papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, its pretty simple. I’ve made a link, and chose a selection to quote by the link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will allow anyone to quickly review the papers, at a glance. Eventually I’d like to include related links, and maybe even some images, who knows. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mark S. Miller is an American computer scientist. He is known for his work as one of the participants in the 1979 hypertext project known as Project Xanadu; for inventing Miller columns; as the co-creator of the Agoric Paradigm[1] of market-based distributed secure computing; and the open-source coordinator of the E programming language. He also designed the Caja programming language.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Miller earned a BS in computer science from Yale in 1980 and published his Johns Hopkins PhD thesis in 2006.[2] Previously Chief Architect with the Virus-Safe Computing Initiative at HP Labs, he is now a research scientist at Google[3] and a member of the ECMAScript (JavaScript) committee.[4] - &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_S._Miller&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Often described as “the founding father of nanotechnology”, Eric Drexler introduced the concept in his seminal 1981 paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which established fundamental principles of molecular engineering and outlined development paths to advanced nanotechnologies. In his 1986 book, Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology, he introduced a broad audience to a fundamental technology objective: using machines that work at the molecular scale to structure matter from the bottom up. Drexler’s research in this field has been the basis for numerous journal articles and a comprehensive, physics-based analysis in Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing, and Computation. In his publications and lectures, Dr. Drexler describes the implementation and applications of advanced nanotechnologies and shows how they can be used solve, not merely delay, large-scale problems such as global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Like all systems involving goals, resources, and actions, computation can be viewed in economic terms. This paper examines markets as a model for computation and proposes a framework–agoric systems–for applying the power of market mechanisms to the software domain. It then explores the consequences of this model and outlines initial market strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Like all systems involving goals, resources, and actions, computation can be viewed in economic terms. Computer science has moved from centralized toward increasingly decentralized models of control and action; use of market mechanisms would be a natural extension of this development. The ability of trade and price mechanisms to combine local decisions by diverse parties into globally effective behavior suggests their value for organizing computation in large systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This paper examines markets as a model for computation and proposes a framework-agoric systems-for applying the power of market mechanisms to the software domain. It then explores the consequences of this model at a variety of levels. Initial market strategies are outlined which, if used by objects locally, lead to distributed resource allocation algorithms that encourage adaptive modification based on local knowledge. If used as the basis for large, distributed systems, open to the human market, agoric systems can serve as a software publishing and distribution marketplace providing strong incentives for the development of reusable software components. It is argued that such a system should give rise to increasingly intelligent behavior as an emergent property of interactions among software entities and people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This line of investigation leads us to propose what may be called the agoric approach to software systems. Agoric stems from agora, the Greek term for a meeting and market place. An agoric system is defined as a software system using market mechanisms, based on foundations that provide for the encapsulation and communication of information, access, and resources among objects. Each of these notions plays a role in supporting computational markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://e-drexler.com/d/09/00/AgoricsPapers/agoricpapers/aos/aos.2.html&quot;&gt;Overview of later sections&lt;/a&gt; (5k)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Section 3: Computation and economic order.&lt;/strong&gt; - Basic characteristics of human markets illuminate the expected nature of computational markets. This section describes some of these characteristics and sketches some of the special issues raised in the context of computation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Section 4: Foundations.&lt;/strong&gt; The foundations needed for agoric open systems may be summarized as support for the encapsulation and communication of information, access, and resources. This section describes these foundations and their role in computational markets.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Section 5:&lt;/strong&gt; Agents and strategies. The foundations of computational markets handle neither resource management (such as processor scheduling and garbage collection) nor market transactions. This section describes the idea of business agents and their use both in replacing centralized resource-allocation algorithms (discussed further by [III]) and in managing complex market behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Section 6:&lt;/strong&gt; Agoric systems in the large. Large, evolved agoric systems are expected to have valuable emergent properties. This section describes how they can provide a more productive software market in human society-opening major new business opportunities-and how they can further the goal of artificial intelligence.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Section 7:&lt;/strong&gt; The absence of agoric systems. If market-based computation is a good idea, why has it not yet been developed? This section attempts to show why the current absence of agoric systems is consistent with their being a good idea.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appendix I:&lt;/strong&gt; Issues, levels, and scale. Agoric open systems will be large and complex, spanning many levels of scale and complexity. This section surveys how issues such as security, reasoning, and trust manifest themselves at different levels of agoric systems.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appendix II:&lt;/strong&gt; Comparison with other systems. Here are reviewed works ranging from those that draw analogies between human society and computational systems to those that explore adaptive computation from an economic point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://e-drexler.com/d/09/00/AgoricsPapers/agoricpapers/aos/aos.3.html&quot;&gt;Computation and economic order&lt;/a&gt; (26k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The objects participating in computational markets must initially be much simpler than the human participants in human markets. Can they participate successfully? Human markets are based on intelligent systems, but this does not show the impossibility of basing markets on simple objects-it merely shows that the argument for agoric systems cannot rest on analogy alone. Explicit attention must be paid to the question of the minimal competence and complexity necessary for an object to participate in a market system. (These issues provide another motivation to form computational “firms” and to open computational markets to human participation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://e-drexler.com/d/09/00/AgoricsPapers/agoricpapers/aos/aos.4.html&quot;&gt;Foundations&lt;/a&gt; (23k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Computational foundations are frequently expressed in the form of programming language or operating system designs. Programming languages have evolved chiefly to provide abstractions for organizing computation on a small scale-the computation occurring inside a single machine and serving a single user. This has unfortunately led many programming lan- guage designers to make decisions (such as providing for global variables or access to arbitrary memory addresses) that make these languages unsuitable for organizing computation on a very large scale. The Actor languages, Argus, the concurrent logic programming languages (such as FCP), and the Mach operating system are examples of systems which have been designed to be extensible to large, open systems. These are covered in this book respectively in [II], [III], [IV], [V], and [VI]. All these projects have arrived at broadly similar models of computation from different directions, suggesting that their common elements will be of general value. This section briefly outlines some of the properties they share-properties which seem important for the implemention of computational markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://e-drexler.com/d/09/00/AgoricsPapers/agoricpapers/aos/aos.5.html&quot;&gt;Agents and strategies&lt;/a&gt; (33k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Current resource allocation policies leave much to be desired. One sign of this is that most computing resources-including CPUs, disk heads, local area networks, and much more-sit idle most of the time. But such resources have obvious uses, including improving their own efficiency during later use. For example, heavily-used programs can be recompiled through optimizing compilers or partial evaluators; pages on disk can be rearranged to keep files contiguous; objects can be rearranged according to referencing structure to minimize paging [47], and so forth. In a computational market, a set of unused resources would typically have a zero or near-zero price of use, reflecting only the cost of whatever power consumption or maintenance could be saved by genuine idleness or complete shutdown. Almost any use, however trivial, would then be profitable. In practice, contention for use would bid up prices until they reflected the marginal value of use [5]. Idle time is a blatant sign of wasteful resource allocation policies; one suspects that it is just the tip of a very large iceberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://e-drexler.com/d/09/00/AgoricsPapers/agoricpapers/aos/aos.6.html&quot;&gt;Agoric systems in the large&lt;/a&gt; (26k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Agoric systems will naturally support a charge-per-use market for software. In any market, software producers will attempt to extract substantial charges from high-volume users. With charge per use, however, the charges to be paid by high-volume users will no longer stand in the way of low-volume users; as a result, they will use expensive software that they could not afford today. At the same time, high-volume users will experience a finite marginal price for using software, rather than buying it and paying a zero marginal price for using it; they will cut back on some of their marginal, low-value uses. The overall benefit of numerous low-volume users making high-value use of the software will likely outweigh the loss associated with a few high-volume users cutting back on their low-value uses, yielding a net social benefit. It seems likely that some of this benefit will appear as increased revenues to software producers, encouraging increased software production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://e-drexler.com/d/09/00/AgoricsPapers/agoricpapers/aos/aos.7.html&quot;&gt;The absence of agoric systems&lt;/a&gt; (6k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Why have agoric open systems not been implemented already? In part, because the software community has lacked an immediate, compelling need. Advances have been made, through better programming environments and methodologies (including the encapsulation and communication of information and access), and through tools for making larger structures visible to programmers [64]-all without building markets. These environments and method- ologies have extended the programmer’s conceptual span of control, enabling one mind or a few closely-coordinated, mutually-trusting minds to build ever larger and more complex programs. These advances have decreased the urgency of enabling extensive cooperation without mutual trust or extensive communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://e-drexler.com/d/09/00/AgoricsPapers/agoricpapers/aos/aos.8.html&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/a&gt; (5k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This paper has examined many of the concrete issues involved in actually creating computational markets, from hardware and software foundations, to initial market strategies for resource management (chiefly in [III]), to the organization of systems of objects and agents able to interact in a market context. As yet, no obstacle to their realization has been found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Distributed systems based on the charge-per-use sale of software services and computational resources promise a more flexible and effective software market, in which large systems will more often be built from pre-existing parts. With many minds building knowledge and competence into market objects, and with incentives favoring cooperation among these objects, the overall problem-solving ability of the system can be expected to grow rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On a small scale, central planning makes sense; on a larger scale, market mechanisms make sense. Computer science began in a domain where central planning made sense, and central planning has thus been traditional. It seems likely, however, that some modern computer systems are already large and diverse enough to benefit from decentralized market coordination. As systems grow in scale and complexity, so will the advantages of market-based computational systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://e-drexler.com/d/09/00/AgoricsPapers/agoricpapers/aos/aos.9.html&quot;&gt;Agorics Open Systems Appendix I&lt;/a&gt; (17k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This section has examined how a range of issues-security, compatibility, trust, reasoning, and coordination-may appear at different levels of market-based open systems. Certain themes have appeared repeatedly. Mechanisms at low levels often support those at higher levels, as (for example) high-level coordination mechanisms using simple serializers. Further, higher levels can inherit characteristics of lower levels, such as encapsulation and conservation laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Issues often blur at the higher levels-security and trust become intertwined, and may both depend on due-process reasoning. The bulk of this paper concentrates on low- and mid-level concerns which must be addressed first, but high-level issues all present a wealth of important research topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://e-drexler.com/d/09/00/AgoricsPapers/agoricpapers/aos/aos.10.html&quot;&gt;Appendix II. Comparison with other systems&lt;/a&gt; (24k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Xanadu hypertext publishing system This paper has compared agoric systems to other systems for computation. Our first exposure to many of the central ideas of markets and computation, however, stems from our work with the Xanadu hypertext system [23]. Xanadu is a proposed on-line publishing medium for hypertext documents. A hypertext document differs from the normal notion of a document in that it contains links, connections between documents which readers can follow at the click of a mouse. Published documents thus form not a set of disconnected islands, but a web connected by references, quotes, criticisms, comments, and rebuttals.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;How can a reader find a path in such an interconnected web? Rather than proposing that someone (somehow) create a single, official system index, the Xanadu project proposes support for decentralized indexing, and hence for pluralism. Any reader can author and publish a guide to any set of public documents. Other readers can then use this guide to sort material and orient themselves. Anyone can, of course, publish guides to other guides. Xanadu relies on the expectation that this activity will result in a spontaneous order-a richly-connected world of documents in which readers can find their way.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Why will indexing be done where needed? In part because readers will do much of the basic searching and sorting for themselves, and then publish the results (since publishing is easy). In addition, however, Xanadu provides a charge-per-read royalty arrangement to encourage publication of material for which there is a demand. Just as charge-per-use software will make it economical to assemble software from diverse components, so Xanadu’s royalty arrangement is designed to encourage the assembly of documents from parts of other documents: if one document quotes another, a reader’s royalty payments are split between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Agoric computation will require market-compatible mechanisms for the allocation of processor time and storage space. Recasting processor scheduling as an auction process yields a flexible priority system. Recasting storage management as a system of decentralized market negotiations yields a distributed garbage collection algorithm able to collect unreferenced loops that cross trust boundaries. Algorithms that manage processor time and storage in ways that enable both conventional computation and market-based decision making will be useful in establishing agoric systems: they lie at the boundary between design and evolution. Algorithms are described in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Agoric computation [I,II] will require market-compatible mechanisms for the allocation of processor time and storage space. Recasting processor scheduling as an auction process yields a flexible priority system. Recasting storage management as a system of decentralized market negotiations yields a distributed garbage collection algorithm able to collect unreferenced loops that cross trust boundaries. Algorithms that manage processor time and storage in ways that enable both conventional computation and market-based decision making will be useful in establishing agoric systems: they lie at the boundary between design and evolution. We describe such algorithms in some detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://e-drexler.com/d/09/00/AgoricsPapers/agoricpapers/ie/ie1.html&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/a&gt; (21k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several systems-programming constraints are important in storage management. First, non-garbage-everything reachable by a chain of strong pointers leading from a well-funded object-must not be collected. Second, garbage-everything that is unreferenced and cannot induce other objects to reference or pay it-should eventually be collected. Finally, overhead costs should be reasonable: bookkeeping storage per object should be bounded and the computational burden of the algorithms should scale roughly linearly (at most) with the number of objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://e-drexler.com/d/09/00/AgoricsPapers/agoricpapers/ie/ie2.html&quot;&gt;Processor scheduling&lt;/a&gt; (21k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This section describes initial market strategies for both sellers and buyers. In processor scheduling, we will term the time-seller (or agent for the seller) an auction house, and a time-buyer (or agent for a buyer) a bidder. A system may have any number of competing sellers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://e-drexler.com/d/09/00/AgoricsPapers/agoricpapers/ie/ie3.html&quot;&gt;Storage management&lt;/a&gt; (44k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In rent-based storage management, we again must specify strategies both for the relationships between buyers and sellers (here, renters and landlords) and for the relationships among renters (in their roles as clients and consultants). The latter are complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://e-drexler.com/d/09/00/AgoricsPapers/agoricpapers/ie/ie4.html&quot;&gt;Initial strategies&lt;/a&gt; for trust (5k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Many of the above algorithms make strategic sense only if one object can trust another object to follow them. For example, there are direct financial incentives to embezzle funds or misreport earnings by violating the dividend algorithm, and there are market-share incentives to produce falsely low cost estimates by violating the base-demand algorithm. Further, improper market intelligence (who is using what services?) can be gleaned by comparing alert- ID values arriving via different consultants. Thus, one needs what may be called initial strategies for trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://e-drexler.com/d/09/00/AgoricsPapers/agoricpapers/ie/ie5.html&quot;&gt;Probabilistic cash&lt;/a&gt; flows (9k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As noted in the discussion of accounting overhead in the dividend algorithm, the incentive structure of an algorithm (in the absence of risk aversion) is determined by its average expected payoffs, which can deviate from its actual payoffs on any given occasion. This principle has general applicability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://e-drexler.com/d/09/00/AgoricsPapers/agoricpapers/ie/ie6.html&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/a&gt; (5k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This paper has explored mechanisms for the allocation of processor time and storage that are compatible both with programming practice and with market mechanisms. Processor scheduling through an auction process yields a flexible, decentralized priority system, allowing a variety of strategies that make tradeoffs involving the speed, certainty, and cost of service. Storage can be managed through auctioning of rental space and decentralized networks of client-consultant relationships. This yields a distributed garbage collection algorithm able both to collect unreferenced loops that cross trust boundaries and to accumulate rough price information to guide economic decisions regarding, for example, local caching in distributed systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Some of these algorithms (e.g., for processor scheduling) have per-decision costs comparable to those of non-market mechanisms in current use; others have costs that are much greater. In general, these costs will be acceptable for objects of sufficient size and processes of sufficient duration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The alert algorithm is the most procedurally intricate of the initial strategies described here, hence it is the one least suited to description in English. It is documented here by code written in the programming language FCP [V,16]; this code has not been run. To facilitate object-oriented programming, we are using a form of syntactic sugar known as “keyword terms” [17].&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A long-standing dream in the field of artificial intelligence has been to use evolutionary processes to produce systems of greater competence than those we can directly design. This paper compares different evolutionary models–such as biological ecosystems, markets, and EURISKO–with respect to this goal. This comparison suggests that a form of ecosystem here termed a direct market (as opposed to the indirect market of human society) is a promising basis for computational ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A long-standing dream in the field of artificial intelligence has been to use evolutionary processes to produce systems of greater competence than those we can directly design. This paper compares different evolutionary models-such as biological ecosystems, markets, and EURISKO-with respect to this goal. This comparison suggests that a form of ecosystem here termed a direct market (as opposed to the indirect market of human society) is a promising basis for computational ecosystems. Related papers [I,II] in this book elaborate a vision of direct computational markets termed agoric open systems.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://e-drexler.com/d/09/00/AgoricsPapers/agoricpapers/ce/ce1.html&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/a&gt; (8k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ecosystems discussed in this paper include Axelrod’s iterated prisoner’s dilemma game [5], which can serve as a sort of E. coli of ecosystems, and biological ecosystems, which are familiar enough to serve as a point of reference for the rest. Others discussed are Lenat’s EURISKO program [III,6], political ecosystems, and what will here be termed direct and indirect market ecosystems. Markets are the central theme-other ecosystems are compared to markets, and markets themselves are generalized from existing human systems to proposed computational systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://e-drexler.com/d/09/00/AgoricsPapers/agoricpapers/ce/ce2.html&quot;&gt;Evolution in ecosystems&lt;/a&gt; (12k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Axelrod tournament Robert Axelrod developed an ecosystem in which the entities interact in rounds of iterated prisoner’s dilemma games [5]. To understand it, one must first understand the dilemma itself. Instead of the traditional scenario of prisoners being interrogated, Hofstadter’s illustration with the following scenario seems more intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Two dealers arrange to trade items. Each dealer agrees to place his item in a bag and leave it at a designated place to be retrieved by the other dealer. The dilemma presents itself when each dealer considers how best to interact with the other-given that they are strangers, will not meet face to face for this exchange, and will never deal with each other in the future. As Hofstadter describes, each dealer reasons as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“`If the [other] dealer brings a full bag, I’ll be better off having left an empty bag, because I’ll have gotten all that I wanted and given away nothing. If the dealer brings an empty bag, I’ll be better off having left an empty bag, because I’ll not have been cheated. I’ll have gained nothing but lost nothing either. Thus it seems that no matter what the dealer chooses to do, I’m better off leaving an empty bag. So I’ll leave an empty bag.’ . . .And so both of you, with your impeccable (or impeccable-seeming) logic, leave empty bags, and go away empty handed. How sad, for if you both had just cooperated, you could have each gained something you wanted to have. Does logic prevent cooperation? This is the issue of the Prisoner’s Dilemma.” [emphasis in the original] [9]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The underlying strategic situation can be made precise in the following fashion: In a single prisoner’s dilemma interaction, two players each choose between moves (termed cooperate and defect) in ignorance of the other’s choice. If both cooperate, both are rewarded (in Axelrod’s case, with a payoff of 3 points). If one cooperates and the other defects, the defector receives an even greater reward (5 points), while the cooperator receives nothing (0 points). If both defect, both are punished (by receiving only 1 point).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In a single move, each player has an incentive to defect regardless of the other player’s move, but double-cooperation is better than double-defection. Overall, pairs of players that cooperate earn higher scores than those that do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In an iterated prisoner’s dilemma game, two players go through a long series of moves, and can base their actions on the history of play. When one expects (and hopes for) further transactions with the other party, simple defection no longer seems as attractive. Indeed, by running a computer tournament, Axelrod showed that the logic of an iterated prisoner’s dilemma actually fosters cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Robert Axelrod ran a Computer Prisoner’s Dilemma Tournament based on the above rules. A diverse group of game theorists were invited to submit programs to play against each other in a round-robin of games, each averaging 200 single moves. After the first tournament, Axelrod circulated the results-including the nature of the winning program, judged by cumulative points-and solicited entries for a second tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Axelrod’s pair of tournaments may be described as a simple evolutionary ecosystem. The replicators were the programs themselves (or the strategies those programs embody), the variation mechanism was human ingenuity (since programs were modified between tournaments), and the selection criterion during a tournament was simply the number of points earned. Programs interacted with each other in an environment imposing certain rules, and their success depended on each others’ behavior. Further, Axelrod went on to simulate the population dynamics of a set of programs, given the assumption that points earned determined the “population density” of that program in the next time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In both tournaments a very simple program won. That program was TIT FOR TAT, submitted by psychologist Anatol Rapoport. In the population dynamics simulation, the success of TIT FOR TAT was even more pronounced. Analyzing TIT FOR TAT’s success can suggest how to analyze other ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://e-drexler.com/d/09/00/AgoricsPapers/agoricpapers/ce/ce3.html&quot;&gt;Evolutionarily stable strategies&lt;/a&gt; (6k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A single population-dynamics process can be described as an ecosystem, but not as an evolutionary ecosystem, since there is no source of variation. Axelrod’s series of two tournaments included variation from one to the next, and hence qualifies. To transform it into a better example of an evolutionary ecosystem, imagine a continuing tournament open to outside contestants able to create new strategies and introduce them in small numbers. In any such open, evolving ecosystem, given no special restrictions on allowable variations, one should expect the ecosystem to become populated primarily by an ESS. The properties of such an ESS will often indicate emergent properties of the system. For example, in any open Axelrod ecosystem most moves will be cooperative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The above discussion of Axelrod’s system benefits from hindsight. The original game-theory experts who submitted the original strategies knew the rules, and those who submitted strategies for the second tournament even had the benefit of a bit of hindsight from the first tournament. Nevertheless, in both cases most of the strategies submitted were not nice, and so were not ESSs. The analyses which follow cover much more complex ecosystems, in which the nature of strategies and payoffs are much more subtle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://e-drexler.com/d/09/00/AgoricsPapers/agoricpapers/ce/ce4.html&quot;&gt;Biological and market ecosystems&lt;/a&gt; (30k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Biological and market ecosystems both contain a mixture of symbiotic and negative-sum relationships. This paper argues that biological ecosystems involve more predation, while idealized market ecosystems involve more symbiosis. Indeed, one can make a case that this is so even for human market ecosystems-that biological ecosystems are, overall, dominated by predation, while market ecosystems are, overall, dominated by symbiosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In human markets (as in idealized markets) producers within an industry compete, but chains of symbiotic trade connect industry to industry. Competition in biology likewise occurs most often among those occupying the same niche, but here, it is predation that connects from niche to niche. Because of the lack of reputations and trademarks, symbiosis in biology occurs most often in situations where the “players” find themselves in a highly-iterated game. In the extreme, the symbiotic system itself becomes so tightly woven that it is considered a single organism-as with lichens composed of fungi and algae, or animals composed of eukaryotic cells containing mitochondria. Predation, of course, links one symbiotic island to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://e-drexler.com/d/09/00/AgoricsPapers/agoricpapers/ce/ce5.html&quot;&gt;EURISKO and markets&lt;/a&gt; (15k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Lenat’s EURISKO system [6] may be viewed as an ecosystem in which the replicators are interacting, evolving heuristics-that is, evolving, computational rules of thumb. Two kinds of heuristics populate EURISKO: object-level heuristics whose subject domain is some topic to be explored (such as war games or three-dimensional VLSI), and meta-heuristics whose subject domain is heuristics. Variation occurs as meta-heuristics create new heuristics from old ones via mutation, and selection occurs as meta-heuristics judge and determine the “interestingness” of heuristics (a numeric value associated with a heuristic). This quantity determines allocation of processing resources, so heuristics compete for survival and influence based on their degree of “interestingness”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://e-drexler.com/d/09/00/AgoricsPapers/agoricpapers/ce/ce6.html&quot;&gt;Memes and markets: direct and indirect market ecosystems&lt;/a&gt; (11k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Human cultures evolve. Their replicators are any of the information patterns which make up a culture, and which spread (with variation) from human to human via imitation. By analogy with genes, these replicators are known as memes [7]; they include ideas, beliefs, habits, morals, fashions, designs, techniques, jokes, and more. Any pattern which can spread via imitation is a meme, even if its human host cannot articulate it or is unaware of its existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is important to recognize that the replicators of human culture are memes, not people. The lack of this distinction has led to the unfortunate confusion called “social darwinism”. Our ability to change our minds allows cultural evolution to proceed not by selection of humans, but, as Karl Popper says, by “letting our theories die in our stead” [4].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like human markets, direct computational markets will have many problems. Computational markets are enough like human societies that it is worth examining mechanisms-such as law and regulation-used by human societies to try to deal with these problems. However, these analogies must be used with care-there are also many differences between human and computational markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Although evolutionary reasoning is most often applied to biological ecosystems, it is also of use in understanding human markets, culture, and politics, and adaptive computational systems such as EURISKO. By assuming that an ecosystem’s foundational rules will shape its evolutionarily stable strategies, and that these strategies will dominate behavior in the ecosystem, one can relate foundations to emergent properties-including properties sought by a designer. This paper has examined a variety of evolutionary ecosystems and compared them with “direct, idealized-market ecosystems”; for the purpose of evolving useful computational behavior, the latter have strong advantages. Other papers in this volume explore the implementation and properties of computational markets of this sort in greater depth [I,II].&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The semantics are defined for a number of meta-instructions which perform operations essential to the writing of programs in multiprogrammed computer systems. These meta-instructions relate to parallel processing, protection of separate computations, program debugging, and the sharing among users of memory segments and other computing objects, the names of which are hierarchically structured. The language sophistication contemplated is midway between an assembly language and an advanced algebraic language.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The capability paradigm is about access control. When a system, such as an OS or a website, is presented with a request for a service it provides, it needs to decide if it should actually do what the requestor is asking for. The way it decides is what we’re talking about when we talk about access control. If you’re like most people, the first thing you’re likely to think of is to ask the requestor “who are you?” The fundamental insight of the capabilities paradigm is to recognize that this question is the first step on the road to perdition. That’s highly counterintuitive to most people, hence the related controversy.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Then, my thesis supervisor said “But you’re wrong, Erlang is extremely object oriented”. He said object oriented languages aren’t object oriented. I might think, though I’m not quite sure if I believe this or not, but Erlang might be the only object oriented language because the 3 tenets of object oriented programming are that it’s based on message passing, that you have isolation between objects and have polymorphism.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mark S. Miller is an American computer scientist. He is known for his work as one of the participants in the 1979 hypertext project known as Project Xanadu; for inventing Miller columns; as the co-creator of the Agoric Paradigm[1] of market-based distributed secure computing; and the open-source coordinator of the E programming language. He also designed the Caja programming language.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Miller earned a BS in computer science from Yale in 1980 and published his Johns Hopkins PhD thesis in 2006.[2] Previously Chief Architect with the Virus-Safe Computing Initiative at HP Labs, he is now a research scientist at Google[3] and a member of the ECMAScript (JavaScript) committee.[4] - &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_S._Miller&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.erights.org/talks/thesis/markm-thesis.pdf&quot;&gt;Robust Composition: Towards a Unified Approach to Access Control and Concurrency Control&lt;/a&gt; by Mark Samuel Miller
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A dissertation submitted to Johns Hopkins University in conformity with the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;271--contributions&quot;&gt;27.1  Contributions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This dissertation makes seven primary contributions:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The object-capability model, a new model of secure computation that is abstract enough to describe both prior object-capability languages and operating systems, and concrete enough to describe authority-manipulating behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A novel approach to concurrency control in terms of attenuating authority, including a unified architecture in which both access control and concurrency control concerns may be addressed together.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A clearly framed distinction between “permission” and “authority.” We develop a taxonomy of computable bounds on eventual permission and authority, enabling us to reason about many simple access abstractions. Using this framework, we provide a unified account of access control and authority in distributed systems consisting of object-capability islands sending messages to each other over a cryptographic capability sea.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A system of reference states, transition rules, and message delivery properties associated with each state, that reify partial failures in a manner that permits robust application-level recovery. In E, these are coupled to language constructs that enable programmers to anticipate and handle distributed plan failures at the syntactic locus where a dependency on remote behavior is introduced. These same syntactic constructs alert the programmer of the loci where interleavings of execution may occur.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A generalization of prior work on promise pipelining from asymmetric client-serversystems to symmetric peer-to-peer systems. Promises enable explicit expression ofdataflow in distributed computation. Promise pipelining enables this computationalstructure to be exploited without cascading round trips.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;An adaptation of non-signaling errors to the propagation of broken references, allowingprogrammers to consistently defer handling of reference failure when direct defense is inappropriate, and to compose chains of data-dependent computation whose referencefailure propagation has a sensible semantics. By providing a coherent error reporting behavior for promise pipelines, this mechanism provides a manageable foundation forrecovery from delayed errors in distributed dataflow computations.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Finally, we introduce E-ORDER, a message delivery ordering constraint that achieves an enforceable middle ground between CAUSAL and FIFO message orderings. The resulting ordering is strong enough to prevent adversaries from exploiting race conditions to obtain inappropriate access, but weak enough to be enforceable. We show how the delivery ordering may be defined in terms of an attenuation of the authority provided by passed references. This allows us to reason about the effects of messaging within our unified model of concurrency and access control.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Several programming systems described in Chapter 26 have adopted (in varying subsets) each of the contributions noted above by borrowing elements from the E system. Twisted Python, in particular, is reported to be in use in more than 50 real-world applications at the time of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;I’m always astounded by the depth to which Mark has explored this space. On more than a few occasions, I’ve come up with an interesting idea for a new protocol or programming language feature or piece of distributed systems infrastructure and told Mark about it, only to find he had already thought of that problem and discovered and solved several issues I hadn’t even thought about yet.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Cap’n Proto RPC &lt;a href=&quot;https://capnproto.org/rpc.html&quot;&gt;https://capnproto.org/rpc.html&lt;/a&gt; is based on E’s network protocol, CapTP, e.g. utilizing The Four Tables:&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://erights.org/elib/distrib/captp/4tables.html&quot;&gt;http://erights.org/elib/distrib/captp/4tables.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto/blob/master/c++/src/capnp/rpc.capnp#L116&quot;&gt;https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto/blob/master/c++/src/capnp/rpc.capnp#L116&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;(You can think of this design as an extension of the file descriptor table concept in Unix, except that both sides may export descriptors to the other side (so that calls can flow either way), and either side can be responsible for assigning the numeric descriptor value for any particular description (which makes it easier to compensate for a high-latency transport).)&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;When I first told Mark I was working on an object-oriented RPC protocol, he insisted I visit him and listen while he explained all this to me, and boy am I glad he did… would have taken a lot longer for me to figure it out myself.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;It’s crazy that most of the content of erights.org was written over 10 years ago – I think some of it goes back to the 90’s, even.&lt;/p&gt;
